Moeen Ali,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316557.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann.While many critics dismissed him as a part-time bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England\s third most-prolific spinner of all time.He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been wasted in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016.He also managed a Test hat-trick, against South Africa at The Oval in 2017, during a series in which he took 25 wickets and scored 252 runs, and played a significant part in England winning the 2015 Ashes, as well as the 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in 2018-19. A measure of his abilities as a Test bowler were his six dismissals of Virat Kohli - the last of which, in what turned out to be Moeen\s final match, took him past Jim Laker\s 193 Test dismissals.It was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. His outstanding 108 not out, spread over 6-and-a-half hours and 281 balls, against Sri Lanka at Headingley took England to within two balls of saving the series but, while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an Englishman in a Test - developed after consulting Saeed Ajmal at Worcestershire - he initially struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling.That changed in training for the Lord\s Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an onlooker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight. It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord\s, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth-highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent.Moeen had already made ODI and T20I debuts in the West Indies, before playing all four of England\s games at the 2014 World T20. And while he struggled to recapture his batting form after that maiden century in Tests, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.Part of the team that failed abysmally at the 2015 World Cup, Moeen was also a key member of the revolution under Eoin Morgan, usually batting at No. 7 - from where he thrashed a 53-ball hundred against West Indies in 2017 - and providing spin back-up to his friend Adil Rashid. His captaincy skills also came to the fore, helping Worcestershire to secure a maiden T20 title and guiding Birmingham Phoenix into the final of the inaugural Hundred. In 2020, he became the first British Asian to captain England in a T20I.He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England Under-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch\s ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties.There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs in 2010 and 1375 runs in 2013 - the year he won the PCA\s Most Valuable Player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline. All the while, his offspin continued to improve.Moeen\s development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace. He became known fondly as the beard that\s feared at New Road.George Dobell"
Mohammad Rizwan,Pakistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320458.png",Right hand Bat, ,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwans international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. A limited batsman but a technically sound keeper when he first rose through the ranks, Rizwan made his international debut shortly after the 2015 World Cup when the slot behind the stumps was still up for grabs. He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistans No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwans game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa in January 2019 serving a ban. On the domestic circuit, Rizwan has been a prolific run-accumulator, averaging a shade under 50 in List A cricket and 41 at first-class level. He doesnt, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfarazs strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. Having made his debut over a decade ago on Pakistans domestic circuit, Rizwan has been an ever-present participant in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy, plying his trade with the hugely successful SNGPL side, helping his side to three titles in the last four years. For that, the reward of a solitary Test cap in 2016 feels somewhat inadequate.He played for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, serving as back-up to Chadwick Walton for a couple of seasons, but once Sarfaraz Ahmed was dropped from the side, Rizwans career trajectory skyrocketed.A 95 in Brisbane in his first Test since being called up got him off to a good start, but it was Pakistans tour to England where he truly cemented his spot as Pakistans first choice wicketkeeper. A pair of half-centuries in Southampton combined with a near-perfect series behind the stumps demonstrated to Pakistan they have found a long-term wicketkeeping solution, and Rizwan found himself appointed vice-captain of the Test side, and fast-tracked into the white ball team.T20s and Rizwan didnt seem naturally suited to each other, but 2021 has seen him make a mockery of those predictions with a record-breaking year. He began by smashing an unbeaten 104 against South Africa, followed up by seven further half-centuries that saw him amass the most T20I runs in a single year by any player. For good measure, he was also the second highest runscorer at the 2021 PSL - behind only his Pakistan opening partner Babar Azam - and led Multan Sultans to the PSL title. His stability and consistency at the top of the order converted what tended to be a Pakistan weakness into a Pakistan strength. Rizwan now appears to be in the prime of his career, and one of Pakistans most prized assets heading into the 2021 World T20.Danyal Rasool"
Aiden Markram,South Africa,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322067.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"The first South Africa captain to win a World Cup, albeit at age-group level, Aiden Markram announced himself as champion material early. He led South Africas Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0. A batter of class and composure, aggressive and strong on the off side, Markram did well in limited-overs cricket as well. In 2021, he was South Africas leading run-maker in ODIs, had a stellar T20 World Cup,  and was named the T20I Player of the Year in Cricket South Africas awards for the year."

Born in South Africa, Phillips moved to New Zealand with his family at the age of five and has come through the cricket set-up in Auckland. He is a multi-dimensional player, who bats, bowls fastish offspin, fields superbly inside the ring and in the outfield, and keeps part-time as well.Although he made his T20I debut for New Zealand in 2017, he only cemented his place in the white-ball sides in 2020, using regular appearances in the CPL to hone his skills. In November 2020 against West Indies, he scored a 46-ball T20I century, then the fastest for a New Zealander, and he finished 2021 with the most sixes in T20s that year. Batting primarily in the middle order, Phillips was instrumental in New Zealands run to the 2021 T20 World Cup final, and played an unforgettable innings in the 2022 edition - a 64-ball 104 against Sri Lanka in a match in which the other 19 batters combined to score 149 runs off the bat. He kicked off 2023 with a counterattacking half-century from No. 7 against Pakistan that clinched New Zealands first ODI series win in the subcontinent since 2008."
Suryakumar Yadav,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/331100/331163.png",Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.He made 73 on his Ranji Trophy debut, for Mumbai in 2010, and the following season scored 754 from nine games, the most by anyone from his team. That tally included a double-century against Orissa in his third match of the season, and a hundred in the next. He capped the season with yet another hundred, in the Duleep Trophy. After a blip in 2012-13, he was back among the runs the next season, where he finished among Mumbais top three run-getters.Suryakumar spent four seasons with Kolkata Knight Riders, starting in their second IPL title-winning year, 2014, though with 608 runs from 54 games he didnt quite provide a foretaste of what he would go on to do with Mumbai Indians in the years that followed.  Suryakumars first international came belatedly in 2021, whereupon he hooked the first ball he faced in a T20I, from Jofra Archer, for six. He produced two fifties in his first three T20Is, and the year after, made 117 off 55 in a game where India fell short in the face of a massive 215 by England."
Tim David,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/340300/340305.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mumbai Indians decision to sign Tim David for INR 8.25 crore (AUD 1.5 million) at the 2022 IPL auction confirmed two things. Firstly, that the games formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the worlds most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months.David, a powerful 6ft 5in middle-order hitter, was born in Singapore but raised in Western Australia, attending Scotch College, a prestigious school in Perths leafy western suburbs. He was offered a state contract by WA in 2018-19 but never made the cut as a senior player. He took the rejection in his stride and threw himself into white-ball cricket, playing for Singapore - including at the T20 World Cup qualifier in 2019 - and winning sporadic opportuntiy for the Scorchers in the BBL.But his rise really started in 2020-21, when former WA bowling coach Adam Griffith lured him to Hobart Hurricanes. After a breakout BBL season, he was picked by Lahore Qalandars for the second half of the PSL: he kept performing, and contracts kept coming: for Surrey, Southern Brave, St Lucia Kings, RCB and Multan, then for Mumbai. In IPL 2022, he faced 86 balls and hit 16 of them for six, finishing the season with the best-ever strike rate for a batter in a single campaign (min. 50 balls) despite being dropped early on in the competition.Davids opportunities have largely come as a finisher but he has occasionally batted at No. 3 and hopes to develop into a versatile T20 batter. He is a genuine power-hitter, particularly strong down the ground in the mould of Kieron Pollard, his team-mate at Mumbai Indians in 2022. After a stress fracture in his foot while on his rookie deal at WA, he switched from seam to spin and now bowls handy offbreaks, and is also a reliable fielder in the deep at long-on or midwicket.ESPNcricinfo staff"

He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.Axar scored an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2013 season but didnt get a game. He had a more impressive season the following year, after switching to Kings XI Punjab - 16 wickets at an economy rate of 6.22 - and was rewarded with a place in the Indian ODI squad for the tour to Bangladesh, though he only played one match.He made his T20 debut against Zimbabwe in 2015, but for the next three years found himself in and out of the limited-overs squads, stepping in more often than not in the absence of Ravindra Jadeja. His Test debut likewise came about when Jadeja was forced to sit out the 2021 England series with a broken thumb. Axar took five wickets on debut in the second Test in Chennai, and followed it up with an 11-wicket haul in the third: he finished the series with 27 wickets. In 2022, he made a 27-ball fifty, his first in ODIs, to seal a series win for India against West Indies."
Dhananjaya de Silva,Sri Lanka,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319800/319859.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"A technically correct top-order batsman from the southern reaches of the island, Dhananjaya de Silva briefly caught the national selectors eye in 2015, then went on to have a bumper domestic season that marked him out for more intensive national duty. De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lankas mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didnt quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings. What followed, though, was an emphatic blooming.De Silva first topped the batting charts in the Super T20 Provincial Tournament in early 2016, hitting 234 runs at a strike rate of 133, in six innings. Months later, he was the star of Tamil Unions first victorious first-class campaign in 55 years, hitting 868 runs at 54.20, which featured a crucial fourth-innings 121 in the match that clinched his team the title. Incredibly, though usually employed as a part-time offspinner, de Silva was also his clubs most successful bowler that season, claiming 32 wickets at 14.23. Those numbers helped earn him his first call-up to Sri Lankas Test squad - for the England tour in May and June 2016.  Andrew Fernando, May 2016"
Bhuvneshwar Kumar,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316658.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the sides fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in Indias first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.\xa0Bhuvneshwar demonstrated his mastery of line and length early, when at 19 he worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first duck in domestic first-class cricket, in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final. He was handy with the bat too - in the 2012-13 Duleep Trophy semi-final he scored 128 batting at No. 8.\xa0He was one of the lone bright spots on Indias otherwise wretched tour of England in 2014, taking 19 wickets - including 6 for 82 in the win at Lords -\xa0at 26.63. However, an ankle injury in Australia put him out of commission for most of the next year, and he played just one game in the 2015 ODI World Cup. When he returned he wasnt quite the same bowler - he had traded swing for increased pace, but not always effectively. Despite two more five-fors in 2016, against West Indies away and New Zealand at home, his appearances in Tests became more sporadic as injuries dogged him, and he played his last series against South Africa in 2018.\xa0It was in white-ball cricket that Bhuvneshwar found his niche. In 2013, six months into his ODI career, he picked up 4 for 8 against Sri Lanka in a tri-series game in the Caribbean, and finished as the leading wicket-taker with ten wickets in four games. By 2017 he had formed a devastating partnership with Jasprit Bumrah, and developed slower balls and yorkers that made him Indias go-to bowler at the death. In February 2018, he became the second Indian bowler after Yuzvendra Chahal to take five wickets in a T20I, against South Africa in Johannesburg. In 2022, he went one better, picking up 5 for 4 against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup.\xa0Bhuvneshwars rise in white-ball cricket mirrored his success in the IPL. He was handed a contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009 but went two seasons without playing a game in the tournament. After another three unremarkable seasons with Pune Warriors, he was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, and quickly rose through the ranks to become the lynchpin of their powerplay and death bowling. He took upwards of 18 wickets in each of his first four seasons, won the purple cap two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017, and was instrumental in Sunrisers only title win, in 2016. Though his performances tapered off in later seasons, he remains the franchises all-time leading wicket-taker."

He was 22 years old at the time.Born in Lahore and a first cousin to the Akmal brothers, Azam made his way up through age-group cricket. His journey began at an under-15 world championship in 2008 and he played two under-19 World Cups in 2010 and 2012, where he was Pakistan\s top run-scorer.We didn\t have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way, Kamran Akmal said. Azam had the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam\s rise was during Pakistan\s isolation as an international venue due to security concerns. His hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies led to a Test debut in the Test series that followed, and Azam had to opportunity to cement his spot as the careers of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq wound down.He would grasp that opportunity, and then some. Over the years that followed, Azam became, far and away, Pakistan\s best batsman, the most famous cricketer in the country, and among the best batsmen in the world. He is, even with so much of his career still ahead of him, one of Pakistan\s best ever batsmen. He was the second fastest player to 2000 ODI runs and the second quickest to 1000 T20I runs. He already has more ODI hundreds than all but two Pakistan batsman, and a World Cup hundred in a crunch game against New Zealand will go down as one of the great individual Pakistan ODI performances. While the first couple of years of Test cricket didn\t bring the instantaneous success of white-ball cricket, steady improvements year on year have seen him rank among the best Test batsmen since the start of 2018, too. Several Pakistan players of this generation have seen regressions after a few years in the side, but Azam, mercifully for Pakistan, seems immune to even that malaise. The increased responsibility Pakistan have dumped upon his shoulders - he was appointed T20I and ODI captain in 2019 before eventually captaining the Test side since 2021 - appears to have had little impact on his personal form for now. While he doesn\t quite have a reputation as one of the deeper thinkers of the game, his captaincy shows embryonic signs of modern progressive thinking, and Azam is very much learning on the job. There appears to be no attempt to ease any of the pressure placed upon relatively young shoulders, but Azam appears not to be feeling the strain for now. Danyal Rasool"

He played a game in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and two years later found himself with the national side in Australia, though he also went on to play the following U-19 World Cup. Soumyas ODI debut came against Zimbabwe in December 2014 and his first Test followed against Pakistan in April the next year, in which he made 33 in each innings. His first Test hundred was 149 against New Zealand in Hamilton; in that innings, he and Mahmudullah put on a 235-run partnership, helping Bangladesh save face after New Zealand racked up 715. In ODIs, Soumya starred with a hundred and three fifties (two of them big) during Bangladeshs golden run in 2015 when they won three series in a row, against Pakistan, India and South Africa.

The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australias Test captain in dramatic circumstances.Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season. Touted to be a future leader of Australias pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998.Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.In the wake of Australias ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nations shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australias coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 mens cricketer of the year. He was immense during the 2019 Ashes in England and through another home series defeat against India in 2020-21, typified by a relentlessness with ball in hand and tremendous stamina.Having been identified as a future captain, his rise to the position came earlier than expected when Tim Paine resigned shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes. However, in a mark of the cricketer and leader Cummins had become it was, given the circumstances, almost a seamless transition. A few months later he had retained the Ashes and secured victory in Pakistan on Australias first tour of the country in 24 years.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were Englands three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lords, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. As he entered his 30s, Buttler reached a new level in short-form cricket, becoming indisputably one of the worlds best T20 batters. In 2022, he hit 863 runs in the IPL - the second-most in a single season - including four centuries to take Rajasthan Royals to the final. Later in the year, after taking over from Eoin Morgan as Englands white-ball captain, he led them to their second mens T20 World Cup title as they achieved their long-stated ambition to hold both World Cups simultaneously. As Buttler and his old friend Alex Hales knocked off a target of 170 with four overs and 10 wickets to spare against India in the semi-final at Adelaide, it seemed bizarre that his promotion to open the batting for Englands T20 team on a permanent basis in 2018 had been so controversial at the time.Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when Indias Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somersets title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somersets run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somersets defeat to Surrey.He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of Englands T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somersets gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lords as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on Englands tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away.There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgans vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of Englands one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career.Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australias Big Bash, Buttlers Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstows back-up during the following winters Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again.He remained integral to the 50-over side building into the World Cup, and started the tournament itself in flying form with 103 off 76 balls in a defeat against Pakistan and a quick half-century against Bangladesh. But time at the middle was limited through the rest of the group stage, and England were so dominant in the semi-final against Australia that he was not required. In the final, his skill in run chases came to the fore: coming in with England wobbling at 86 for 4 in a chase of 242, he kept them alive with 59 off 60 balls in a 110-run stand with Ben Stokes, and while he could not see them home, he managed seven runs off three balls in the Super Over, and completed the run-out of Martin Guptill to win England the trophy.The highs of World Cup success were quickly forgotten, as Buttler cut a tired figure over the next six months. He struggled for runs in the Ashes and in South Africa, and with Bairstow and Ben Foakes breathing down his neck, it seemed a matter of time before he would lost his Test place. He responded with a breathless 75 off 101 in the home summer against Pakistan to seal a run chase at Old Trafford, before grinding out his highest Test score - 152 - in the final match of the series. By this stage firmly ensconced as Englands T20I opener, he continued to lead from the front in their bid to hold both World Cups simultaneously.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

He also represented the Netherlands at two subsequent World Twenty20s where he has carried one of their most potent threats. He switched to Tasmania for the 2012-13 Australian season, and appeared for two Twenty20 franchises - the Hobart Hurricanes in Australias Big Bash League and the Northern Knights in New Zealand. County cricket soon came calling and he had an outstanding debut season for Glamorgan in 2016, taking 82 wickets in all formats and dominating the countys end-of-season awards as he helped take the bowling weight off Michael Hogan, Glamorgans indefatigable Australian. He took five wickets on five occasions, including career best figures of 5 for 61 against Northants at Swansea, and had a memorable T20 debut for Glamorgan when he took 4 for 14 against Surrey at the Kia Oval. The following season was disrupted by a shoulder injury suffered in the field playing for Netherlands against Hong Kong in an Inter-Continental Cup game.He continued to balance Dutch international duties with county cricket, though he underwhelmed in 2019 in Glamorgan colours.He was only 15 when he made his Sydney first-grade debut for the University of NSW in 2006. At the time, only six players had appeared in Sydney first-grade at a younger age.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the countrys Full Member era.A tall, hulking presence at the crease, Zazai made waves as a 20-year-old by striking back-to-back half-centuries in just his second and third matches to ensure a T20I series sweep of Ireland. In the final match at Bready, he single-handedly outscored Ireland with his 82 off 54 balls, which included seven sixes.If that wasnt enough to grab headlines, then hitting six sixes in an over less than two months later did the trick while batting for Kabul Zwanan against Balkh Legends in the inaugural season of the Afghanistan Premier League in Sharjah. Having already bashed a 44-ball ton earlier in the tournament, Zazais intimidation factor grew exponentially when he became the sixth batsman in competitive cricket, and third in T20s, to achieve the six sixes feat after carving up left-arm spinner Abdullah Mazari to put his name alongside Yuvraj Singh and Garry Sobers, among others, in the record books. Hidden in the euphoria of the six sixes was the fact that Zazai matched Yuvraj and Chris Gayle for the fastest fifty in all T20 cricket off 12 balls. In February 2019, he belted an unbeaten 162 off 62 balls against Ireland in just his fifth T20I which included a record 16 sixes, one of many benchmarks set on the day both for himself and Afghanistan in a world record T20 total of 278. Time will tell if Zazai can make a similar impact in ODI and Test cricket for Afghanistan.Peter Della Penna"

Early the following year he produced 159 off 189 balls in a giant India total in Sydney, which sealed their first series in Australia. An encore followed early in 2021, when he made a brisk 97 at the SCG, helping wrest a draw off Starc, Cummins, Lyon and Hazlewood after India were staring down the barrel. Pants finest batting hour came in the classic that followed in Brisbane: an unbeaten 89 to steer a veritable India third XI home in a tall chase, and to their second series win down under in two visits. In Cape Town at the start of 2022, he made an almost ludicrous 100 off 139 in an India total where the next highest score was 29. And later that year, he set India up with a rapid 146 in the first innings of the postponed last Test of their tour of England from 2021 - only for England to outgun them in a berserker fourth-innings chase.It is a mark of Pants no-fear, no-brakes batting that in his first four years in the game, he had as many scores between 90 and 100 in Tests as he did hundreds. It is the only way he has known: a year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at 18 in 2015, Pant scored a triple-hundred against Maharashtra, followed by two blistering centuries in a game against Jharkhand a month on - one of them ending in 135 off 67 balls.With Test stats like his, Pants numbers in T20 - close to 3000 runs over seven seasons for Delhi Capitals, at a strike rate of 148 - dont seem especially remarkable, but he has been a force for the Delhi side, their all-time top-scorer, and was appointed captain in 2021. He was bought at auction by the franchise the day he made a hundred in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup that took India into the semi-finals of that tournament."

In December 2018, Raza, who has juggled a job as a bank officer while playing professional cricket, was one of three UAE players suspended for eight weeks for criticising the ground facilities in Karachi. A year later he became UAEs captain and led them when they qualified for the 2022 T20 World Cup. In January 2020, he took his first ODI five-for, against Namibia in Al Amerat. At the same venue, two years later, he took his maiden T20I five-for, against Nepal.Despite his success in T20Is, he was removed as the captain ahead of the 2022 World Cup (but retained the ODI role) after the selectors chose to split the captaincy."

It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word talent was Rohit\s bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him Hitman when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli\s absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022."

Wiese had not played international cricket since March 2016, and turned down a call-up for a home T20I series against Sri Lanka in making his decision to go Kolpak. Five years later he became eligible to play for Namibia based on ancestry. He made his debut in the opening round of the T20 World Cup and helped his new team qualify for the Super 12s, winning two Player-of-the-Match awards on the way. Six months on, he was part of the Namibia side that won their first series against a Full Member when they beat Zimbabwe 3-2 in a T20I series in Bulawayo.An imposing allrounder, with the skills to take pace off the ball, and a strong lofted drive, Wiese was a late bloomer who came to prominence in the shorter formats. He began his career at Easterns and in 2005 established himself as a regular at the provincial union and the Titans franchise.As Jacques Kallis career wound down and South Africa needed to look for other options, Wiese came into contention. He was taken on the 2013 tour of Sri Lanka and played in the three T20Is, but modest returns sent him back to the domestic system.The 2014-15 summer was among Wieses best, with impressive performances in Titans One-Day Cup win, which helped nail down a more regular place for him in South Africas T20I squad. A career-best 5 for 23 against West Indies in 2015 highlighted his ability to bowl cutters and slower balls. The IPL was watching: in that years auction, Wiese was picked up by Royal Challengers Bangalore for US$460,000. He went to the World T20 in 2016 but after failing to cement a spot, took the Kolpak route to county cricket. After a lean first season with Sussex, he improved in 2018, taking 41 wickets and passing the 500-run mark in the Championship and providing late-order impetus as his side reached the Vitality Blast final, while his breath-taking 171 off 126 balls in a 50-over defeat at Hampshire was one of the innings of the 2019 season."

He bowls with a high-arm action, after coming in from a smooth run-up. He is a product of Dhakas cricket academy scene, having learned his craft at the Abahani ground nets, living nearby in Mohammadpur.He burst into the domestic scene with a four-wicket haul in the 2013 BPL, but he suffered a knee injury soon after which kept him sidelined for nearly a year. He went through rehabilitation work during the time, and as he slowly recovered, Taskin bowled in the Bangladesh nets regularly.The coaching staff was impressed by his ability, and kept him in the radar for a very long time, until they found the right time to blood him.

Hasaranga made a rapid 87 on first-class debut with Ports Authority Cricket Club, and, having switched to Colombo Cricket Club, hit 586 runs at an average of 39.06 and a strike rate of 93 in the 2017 Premier League Tournament. When this first-class runs tally was followed by a stretch of good bowling form in List A domestic tournaments, Hasaranga piqued the national selectors interest. He was chosen in Sri Lankas squad for the first two one-dayers against Zimbabwe in June 2017, with his fielding also cited as a reason for his selection.

Bowling predominantly with the new ball, he took eight wickets in the first three games of that series and 7 for 19 in the fourth, where Afghanistan successfully defended 134. The month after, he starred in a historic U-19 Asia Cup title win for Afghanistan, taking 5 for 13 as his team beat Pakistan in the final.Early in 2018, at the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, he took 4 for 14 to beat the home team and set up a semi-final against Australia. That week he was signed by Kings XI Punjab (for about US$630,000) for whom he took 14 wickets in that years IPL. By the time he played that tournament, he had become the youngest to take five wickets in an ODI - against Zimbabwe in a Sharjah bilateral game that February which Afghanistan won comfortably - at the age of 16 years and 325 days.

Three years earlier, Hales had watched England lift the 50-over World Cup from his sofa; he was dropped a month before the tournament after news of a failed recreational drugs test broke in the media, prompting what Eoin Morgan described as a complete breakdown in trust between him and his team-mates.He did not play for England again under Morgan\s leadership and was initially left out of their squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup. But Jonny Bairstow broke his leg on the golf course while the squad was being announced, and after discussions with Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott, Rob Key decided the time was right to end Hales\ three-year international exile.He played warm-up series against Pakistan and Australia but came to life when England\s knockout hopes were on the line, hitting 52 and 47 in must-win games against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. And in the semi-final at Adelaide Oval - a ground he had grown to love while playing in the Big Bash League - Hales hit 86 not out off 47 balls, including seven sixes, as England cantered to a 10-wicket win over India with four overs unused. Hales made only 1 in the final but England still beat Pakistan by five wickets at the MCG; having feared his chance had gone, he finally lifted a World Cup. Nine months later, he decided that he should bow out on a high and retired from international cricket, reconfirming his continued availability in franchise leagues.At 6ft 5in, Hales was always a destructive players who thrived against fast bowling and was considered part of a brazen new breed of England batters when he made his international debut in 2011. Sporting talent is in his genes - his grandfather once took Rod Laver to five sets at Wimbledon - and Hales was the first Englishman to score a T20I hundred, an unbeaten 116 against Sri Lanka in the 2014 World T20.\nIt still took three years for him to make his ODI debut and the consistent mistrust of his skills in 50-over cricket encapsulated England\s struggles heading into the 2015 World Cup. He was only brought into the side when qualification was on the line, and even then asked to bat out of position.He was backed and emboldened by Morgan, Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace after the World Cup, who retained him in their one-day side even when he endured a lean 2015 summer. ODI hundreds in Cape Town and Abu Dhabi over the 2015/16 winter vindicated their decision and in 2016, he broke Robin Smith\s long-standing record for the highest score by an Englishman in ODIs, hitting 171 off 122 as England racked up a then-record 444 for 3 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge.By that stage, Hales\ brief Test career had come and gone. England picked him for a tour to South Africa in 2015/16 and he played 11 times for them in all, hitting five half-centuries with an average of 27.28. But his strike rate of 43.84 spoke of a batter who found himself shackled by Test cricket, rather than liberated.\nIn 2017, Hales allowed his position as first-choice opener to slip away. He was suspended from the ODI side in the aftermath of a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017, also involving Ben Stokes, which gave Jason Roy the chance to make a successful comeback to the side; Roy and Hales had previously formed a spectacular opening partnership, but Roy\s with Bairstow was even better.\nIn February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball-only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He struck 147 at Trent Bridge during that rarest of things - an England whitewash in a one-day series against Australia.He was due to spent the 2019 World Cup as England\s spare batter, ready to fill in whenever injury struck, but a second failed test for recreational drugs left him in limbo under the ECB\s regulations: he was banned for 21 days, but the reason was not made public; Nottinghamshire said personal reasons were behind his absence.The truth was revealed by the Guardian while England were at a training camp in Cardiff, blindsiding Morgan. Morgan met with senior players and told Bayliss and Ashley Giles that Hales had to go. Hales spent the next three years travelling around the world, filling his boots in franchise leagues and waiting for a recall, which finally came in 2022.ESPNcricinfo staff"

A left-hand lower-middle-order batter and occasional legspinner, Burl broke into the Zimbabwe side in 2017, and has also played in the BPL and Afghanistans Shpageeza Cricket League.Sports-mad Burl studied at Peterhouse Boys School outside of Harare, which has produced England internationals Gary Ballance and the Currans, Sam and Tom; Italian rugby star Sebastian Negri; and Olympic rower Peter Purcell-Gilpin. Burl made his Zimbabwe U-17 and U-19 debuts within a month of each other in 2010-11, and his first-class debut, for Mashonaland Eagles, in 2014; in his second match of the Logan Cup that season, he made 92 and 66.A century and two fifties against Afghanistan A in January 2017 paved the way for his ODI debut the following month, against the senior Afghanistan side. By the end of that year, he would also make his Test debut against South Africa.The following year there came another batting high in the Logan Cup: 134 and 72 not out in a match against Mashonaland Eagles, which capped a run that started in April that year, during which he produced six scores of over 50 in five games, two of them hundreds. In mid-2019, Burls batting in international white-ball cricket seemed to kick into a higher, more consistent, gear. He hit a 28-ball 54 in a T20I series-winning effort against Bangladesh in 2022. A month later, Burl, a part-time legspinner, starred in Zimbabwes first win in any format in Australia, taking 5 for 10 in three overs in an ODI in Townsville."

He struck a century and three fifties, before having to head to the Bangladesh Under-19 training camp ahead of the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. The opportunity to get out of age-group cricket quite early proved to be an important milestone in his development. His first-class debut in the 2013-14 season wasn\t memorable: he got a pair against Khulna in Cox\s Bazar. But in the following season, he struck 250 and 282, his first two hundred-plus scores in first-class cricket. He added another double-hundred in 2015. A Twenty20 International debut followed in January 2016, but it was a forgettable one against Zimbabwe. By then it was clear that he wouldn\t be in coach Chandika Hathurusingha\s 2016 World T20 plans.Mosaddek however kept making the runs in domestic cricket, and in the 2016 Dhaka Premier League he was winning matches for eventual champions Abahani. At barely 20, Mosaddek was hailed by Abahani captain Tamim Iqbal as one with a 45-year-old brain. He remained on the fringes of the national team, and made his Test debut in Colombo in March 2017 in what was Bangladesh\s 100th Test.  Mohammad Isam"

Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder. He made his first-class debut in 2008 at the age of at 18 and two years later, his international debut on South Africa\s tour of West Indies. But it was only in 2013 that he became a regular at international level and it took another two years for him to get his first ODI century: 130 against West Indies in January 2015, followed swiftly by an unbeaten 138 two matches later, which sent him to the World Cup in good form. He made an 18-ball 49 in the semi-final that South Africa narrowly lost to New Zealand. Miller spent even longer waiting for a milestone in T20I cricket. His first fifty in the format came in March 2016. Both speak more to lack of opportunity in limited-overs cricket, rather than lack of ability. At the IPL, Miller was one of the mainstays of Kings XI Punjab for eight years, scoring over 350 runs in each season between 2013 and 2015 and captaining them in 2016. In 2022, he had his best IPL season, scoring 481 runs and striking at 142.72 in Gujarat Titans\ title-winning campaign."

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which hes made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasnt until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt.However, his prolific form earned him a contract in the PSL with the Lahore Qalandars. He showed flashes of the class hed been displaying domestically, particularly during a 33-ball 56 against Karachi where he destroyed the opposition bowling and looked extremely elegant while doing so. It earned him a call-up to Pakistans T20I side for the West Indies tour, and he made his debut in the second match in Port of Spain.His first three T20Is only brought him 26 runs, and much of the world was still unaware of his talent when he made his ODI debut a couple of months later, in England, during the 2017 Champions Trophy. Having missed the opening-match defeat to India, Zaman turned Pakistans batting fortunes around with scores of 31, 50, 57 and 114 in his first four ODI innings, his strike rate of 113.00 giving a dated 50-overs line-up much-needed oomph at the top of the order. The maiden hundred went on to win him the Player-of-the-Match award in the final, setting up a total of 338 that proved a long way beyond Indias reach.Danyal Rasool"

He is not a teenage prodigy, nor is he someone who had a burning ambition to play for his country. He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it.Born in Sialkot in the northeast of Pakistan, Sikandar had told his parents when he was 11 years old that he wanted to be a fighter pilot. He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.Not dissuaded, Sikandar got admitted to Glasgow Caledonian University, where he picked up cricket as a semi-professional. He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured. He did well, and it became clear that he had a future in Zimbabwe colours.Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) began a process to get him the necessary papers that would qualify him to play for the country and in May 2013, he made his international debut for Zimbabwe, in the first ODI against Bangladesh, thus becoming the 116th player to appear for Zimbabwe in the format. Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwes top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner. He played a pivotal role in one of Zimbabwes most memorable moments on a cricket field, winning the deciding ODI against Sri Lanka with a crucial cameo in a pressure situation chasing 204 on a turning track in Hambantota in July 2017. Before batting, he had helped restrict Sri Lanka in that game with what was his best figures in ODI cricket: 3 for 21 in 10 overs. The result? Zimbabwe had won a five-match ODI series away from home for the first time.Mohammad Isam"

An Australian Under-19 representative - he made 104 against South Africa in the 2005-06 Youth World Cup - Cooper broke into the senior South Australian side in November 2008.His early successes came in limited-overs games, starting with 53 in his first one, against Western Australia at Adelaide Oval, and a month later he hit 101 against New South Wales at the SCG. But he really opened eyes with an innings of 160 not out for the Prime Ministers XI against the touring West Indians at Canberra in February 2010. Cooper spanked six sixes and 14 fours, and made a decent game of it after similar fireworks earlier from Chris Gayle (146 from 89 balls) had propelled the West Indians to an eye-watering total of 399 in their 45 overs.Later in 2010, Cooper decided to play in the Netherlands, from where his mother hails. This connection allowed him to be fast-tracked into the Dutch national side, and he made an unprecedented start by scoring half-centuries in each of his first three full one-day internationals. He added a century in his fifth game, and 96 in his seventh - both against Afghanistan - at which point his ODI average stood at a lofty 81.33, admittedly all against Associate opposition. It dropped a little when he encountered Test bowlers (with 8 v Bangladesh in Glasgow). Time will tell if Cooper can emulate Dirk Nannes and swap an orange shirt for a green-and-gold one.Steven Lynch"

He impressed, too, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. He had made his international debut against India in a T20I in February of that year.Mitchell scored his maiden Test hundred at the start of 2021, in an innings win over Pakistan in Christchurch, and his first ODI century that March. In T20Is, when promoted to open at the 2021 World Cup in the UAE, Mitchell played a key role in New Zealands run to the final, with an unbeaten 72 against England in the semis. Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including 190 at Trent Bridge.He made his first-class debut at the end of the 2011-12 season and came to prominence by averaging 54.53 the following year. And though he was primarily a middle-order batter, his seam bowling became a useful asset over the years. He won a place in the New Zealand A squad to tour India and Sri Lanka, and while he found life tougher there, he responded with centuries in successive innings the following domestic season. An unbeaten 170 against Canterbury shortly before the England series in 2019 ensured he was in the selectors thoughts, and when de Grandhomme was forced to pull out of the second Test, Mitchell was selected.He is the son of former New Zealand rugby union player and coach John Mitchell, who, at the time of his sons Test debut against England, was defence coach for the England rugby union side that lost in the World Cup final."

By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa. De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African U-19 side, which he captained briefly. He also topped the batting charts for South Africa in the 2012 junior World Cup in Australia.Later that year he caught the national selectors eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth in the first-class rankings in the 2012-13 season. After a bit of a false start to his international career - he didnt do much against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 - he scored his first ODI hundred against Pakistan later that year. Then came the three in a row against India, followed by his Test debut early in 2014. An ankle injury threatened to put de Kock out of the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly - if only to struggle through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh, after which he was dropped and spent some productive time in the A team. His first Test hundred came against England in Centurion in 2016, and he followed that up with one against Australia three matches later in Adelaide, in a series South Africa won 2-1. He also hit his stride in the shortest format, scoring his maiden half-century in the T20 World Cup that year, in which he was South Africas most successful batter. Elsewhere in T20, he was a key part of the Mumbai Indians side that won two IPL titles on the trot at the tail end of the 2010s, opening their batting and keeping. In late 2021, de Kock announced a shock retirement from Tests, becoming another in a growing list of top all-format players seeking to concentrate on the white-ball formats."

Mahmud is still at a very early stage of his career, having just played a single T20I for Bangladesh, and earned a maiden call-up in the ODI side in January 2021, but already he has earned plenty of praise from Bangladeshs coaches for his ability to bowl fast, full and accurately. Mahmud is also one of the rarities in Bangladesh cricket, in that he is also a very good outfielder among the pace bowlers. He is not very tall, but with an action that is mostly front-on, he generates enough pace to beat the bat. During the Bangabandhu T20 Cup in November 2020, Mahmud took eleven wickets for eventual champions Gemcon Khulna, which got him the ODI call-up against West Indies.He mainly emerged from the BCBs age-group structure, having first played for the Chattogram Under-16s in 2015, since he is from Laxmipur, a district within the Chattogram Division. He developed for three years in the system, culminating in his nine wickets in the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.He quickly followed it up with 12 wickets in the Dhaka Premier League (List-A) and continued to play for the Under-23 side. In the 2019-20 season, he took ten wickets each in the BPL (T20s) and Bangladesh Cricket League (first-class) competitions, before making his T20I debut against Zimbabwe in March 2020.Mohammad Isam"

An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, hes been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother.Riaz Afridi made his solitary Test performance for Pakistan in 2004, when Shaheen was just four years old. He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistans informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme. His pace, physique and fitness won him an U-16 tour of Australia, and since then, hes been progressing through the youth squads. He burst into the nations consciousness with 8 for 39 on Quaid-e-Azam Trophy debut, the best-ever figures by a debutant in the competition. Later, he was picked for the PSL, where figures of five wickets for four runs in a group game for Lahore Qalandars won him a place in the T20I squad against the West Indies. He became the first cricketer born after the turn of the millennium to represent Pakistan when he played the third T20I against the West Indies. He was later handed an ODI debut in the Asia Cup, where he replaced Mohammad Amir in the side. In December, he became the 35th player to make his Test debut for Pakistan under the age of 19.There is more to him than just his story, however compelling that may be in its own right. He stands at an imposing 6ft 6in, though a sweet, child-like smile and a harmless demeanour perhaps takes some of the aura away. He has the intelligence to take advantage of his height to extract bounce on the docile pitches of the UAE, while a mean yorker has proved especially difficult for batsmen to deal with. Most impressively, he can hit a good length time and again, and appears to have the temperament for a long career at this level. There have been flattering comparisons already, with Pakistan boasting a rich tradition of left-arm fast bowling. In truth, he really is nothing like Wasim Akram or Mohammad Amir, both of whom were shorter bowlers who relied more on swing than bounce. Perhaps the most accurate contemporary comparison is to Mitchell Starc, something Mickey Arthur pointed out during the PSL earlier this year. He has made an impressive start to international cricket, but for Shaheen, many sense this is indeed, just the start. Danyal Rasool"

Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhis journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds.Born in Ludhiana, in the Indian state of Punjab, Sodhi began his cricket in south Auckland, where his parents had migrated in his youth. Papatoetoe High School is not renowned for its cricket, and perhaps as a result, Sodhi had trouble establishing himself in regional representative teams, and may have also been a victim of Aucklands pitches that provide little aid to spin bowlers, and captains who are not versed in how to use them. Undeterred, Sodhi left school early and a training stint with Dipak Patel and Matt Horne was when his career finally got some traction. A move to Northern Districts allayed the frustration of not being able to displace the spinner in the Auckland side, and after an encouraging 2012-13 season, Sodhi earned a trip to the subcontinent with New Zealand A, which cleared the path to the New Zealand side.Andrew Fidel Fernando"

Inconsistency and injury were his nemeses, however, and that led to him abandoning international cricket with South Africa and signing a three-year deal with Worcestershire as a Kolpak after the 2018 English season.Parnell signed immediately after becoming a member of the Worcestershire side that won the T20 Blast for the first time. He had played six Tests, 65 ODIs and 40 T20 matches for South Africa, but none since October 2017.Parnell was schooled at Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, the alma mater of Graeme and Peter Pollock, and began playing provincially when he was 12. He played at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-19 levels, and made his first-class debut for Eastern Province in 2006-07.He was part of South Africas Under-19 squad for the 2006 World Cup in Sri Lanka and captained them in the 2008 edition in Malaysia. Parnell led by example, taking 18 wickets - the most in the tournament - and scored useful runs in the middle-order to steer South Africa to the final.Thereafter, he went on the Emerging Players tour of Australia before earning a call-up to the senior one-day squad for a series in early 2009. He had a modest debut against Australia, but later became the youngest player to be handed a national contract by Cricket South Africa, and soon repaid their faith. At the 2009 World T20, Parnell snaffled nine wickets and had an economy rate of less than six. That included an impressive 4 for 13 against West Indies.   After a successful county stint with Kent, Parnell made his Test debut against England in the fourth match at the Wanderers in January 2010. He played three Tests that year and earned a lucrative IPL contract when Delhi Daredevils splashed out US$ 610,000 on him. A groin injury, however, ruled him out of the tournament. It would impact the next summer as Parnell was unable to tour Sri Lanka in August with the South Africa A side. But he recovered in time for the ODI series against Zimbabwe at home. Parnell played just one match in the 2011 World Cup and was also part of the 2012 World T20. He was not considered for the Champions Trophy the following year. Instead, he was given an opportunity in Tests when he was included in South Africas team to play a must-win match against Australia in Port Elizabeth in February 2014. Parnell announced his return with a wicket off his first ball and added another two deliveries later. He, however, bowled just eight more overs before leaving the field with another groin injury. He recovered for the World T20 a month later and played in ODIs in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Parnell played just one match in South Africas 2015 World Cup campaign, and didnt make it to their World T20 squad a year later.Parnell, though, dominated the domestic scene in the 2015-16 season. Despite a foot niggle, he was the third-highest wicket-taker in the one-day cup and Cobras most successful bowler, despite playing nine of their 11 games. In the same season, Parnell opened the batting on several occasions in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge with a fair amount of success. He blossomed as the season drew to a close and took 18 wickets in the last two first-class matches to finish with 23 from five matches.Firdose Moonda"

He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England\s nearly men.But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - It was like facing 90mph legbreaks, Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes\ batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests to that point with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord\s and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287.Then, at Lord\s, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of Wisden\s Cricketers of the Year for his efforts.In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county\s bowling averages with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like to clone as the template for all players.After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing sporadically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.The following summer changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England\s attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord\s.A year later Woakes helped England to secure a dramatic, maiden World Cup win - his importance never more apparent than during the new-ball spell that helped reduce Australia to 14 for 3 in the semi-final at Edgbaston. Improvements with the Kookaburra ball were apparent during one-off appearances in New Zealand and South Africa that winter, and his mastery at home saw him named PCA Player of the Year in 2020, having averaged 20.24 in five behind-closed-doors Tests against West Indies and Pakistan, as well as scoring an unbeaten 84 at Old Trafford to secure a fourth-innings chase of 277 by three wickets.George Dobell"
Anrich Nortje,South Africa,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322080.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Anrich Nortje is a genuine quick who has been described as extremely exciting by none other than Dale Steyn. Like Steyn, Nortje is not a product of a big city but comes from the town of Uitenhage, north of Port Elizabeth, which is home to the largest Volkswagen factory in the African continent. It\s hardly surprising then, that Nortje is well-acquainted with speed. He regularly sends the speed gun over 150kph and has a fearsome bouncer. Nortje was schooled at Brandwag High and went on to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree in financial planning at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, where he used varsity cricket to hone his skills. Nortje enjoyed a strong start to his first-class franchise career, with 20 wickets in four matches in the 2016-17 season and a fifth-place finish on the first-class wicket charts in the 2017-18 summer, when he was the second-highest wicket-taking seamer. But the shorter format was where he got his big break. Nortje stormed onto the scene in late 2018, in the inaugural edition of the Mzansi Super League, South Africa\s franchise T20 competition, with express pace that helped him take eight wickets in three matches for the Cape Town Blitz. His sensational start did not last too long and he was forced out of the tournament with an ankle injury, which required surgery. He recovered by early 2019 and made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in March 2019. Nortje played four of the five matches in the series with a best return of 3 for 57 at his home ground in Port Elizabeth and appeared to have made a strong case for inclusion in the 2019 World Cup squad. Nortje\s career appeared to be on the ascendancy when he was contracted by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2019 IPL but had to withdraw from the tournament when he picked up a shoulder injury. Despite that, he was named in South Africa\s World Cup squad and had recovered in time for the tournament but broke his thumb in training ahead of the team\s departure. An opportunity to tour with the national side finally came in September-October 2019, when Nortje was named in the squad for a T20I and Test series in India. He made his debuts in both formats there.

King also debuted in the CPL in 2017 with St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, but flew under the radar until his switch to Guyana Amazon Warriors in 2019, where coach Johan Botha spotted his potential and bumped him up the order. He responded with 496 runs in 12 games, the most by anyone in the tournament that year, at a strike rate of 149, including an unbeaten 132 against Barbados Tridents, then the highest individual score in the CPL.A step-up to the national squad seemed the natural order of things, but though King produced acceptable, if not earth-shattering performances in limited-overs series against Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, he was dropped from the side in late 2020. On his recall a year later, he scored fifties in T20Is against Pakistan and England, and an unbeaten 58 and 91 in an ODI series win against Netherlands."

For an upcoming left-handed opening batsman, especially in the modern game, that\s a fairly smart pick.Lewis moved up the ranks playing age-group cricket for Trinidad & Tobago, and was part of a championship winning Under-19 side in 2008. His List A debut came in October 2009, when he struck a half-century playing for West Indies U-19s. The following January he was representing them at the World Cup.  Like Gayle, Lewis\ best has come in the T20 circuit. In 2013, he was Trinidad & Tobago\s top-scorer in the Champions League with a strike-rate of 141.61. He showed big-match credentials, striking 62 off 46 balls in the semi-final against a Mumbai Indians attack comprising Mitchell Johnson and Harbhajan Singh. The following year, at the Caribbean Premier League, he made 321 runs from eight innings, the most by a T&T Red Steel batsman and only 42 behind Gayle, who had played 11 innings. By this time, Lewis began to attract overseas interest. He hit 101 not out off 65 balls in his first stint at the Bangladesh Premier League, which paved the way for his first West Indies call-up, for a World T20 no less. Lendl Simmons had been injured for the early part of the 2016 tournament, which helped Lewis\ dream come true. Ironically, his maiden T20, List A and first-class centuries came after the T&T board took away his domestic contract. \n\nESPNcricinfo Staff"
Ravichandran Ashwin,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316521.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it. His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.Among the highlights of Ashwins Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the publics reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in Indias run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name."
Kagiso Rabada,South Africa,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320300/320376.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. Rabada thrust himself into the international spotlight at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 6 for 25 against Australia in the semi-final. South Africa went on to win the title - their first - and Rabada finished as their highest wicket-taker.  Three months later, he was awarded a franchise contract with Lions and before the year was up, he had been included in the national ODI and Test squads. He made his T20I debut against Australia in Adelaide in November 2014.  In early 2015, Rabada showed his ability in the longer format. He claimed the South African record for the best bowling figures in a first-class match, 14 for 105, surpassing the haul taken by Dale Steyn seven seasons before. He finished the season as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Sunfoil Series. He was included in all three squads to tour Bangladesh in July-August 2015, and became only the second player to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, eventually finishing with the best figures by a first-timer: 6 for 16. Rabada also played in a home series against New Zealand and was then included on a tour to India. There, he led the ODI wicket-takers list with Steyn after both claimed 10 wickets. Injuries to Morne Morkel, then Steyn and Vernon Philander, meant Rabada got a chance to play in three of the four Tests of that series. On inhospitable pitches, he worked hard, often without reward but displayed the stamina required of a Test bowler. Rabada has had more assistance from the surfaces at home, where he played against England in the absence of Steyn and Philander. In the final Test, with South Africa having already lost the series, Rabada became the youngest South African to take 10 wickets in a match when he finished with 13 for 144. His workload did not lessen as he played a further four ODIs and two T20Is against England, three T20Is against Australia, and also led the attack at the 2016 World T20 in India. After his performances, Rabada seemed primed for an IPL stint but chose to sign a county deal with Kent for a month instead.  Firdose Moonda"
Curtis Campher,Ireland,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321300/321343.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Born in Johannesburg, raised in South Africa and a player for the national Under-19 side, Curtis Campher decided to leave his homeland behind and put his Irish passport to good use in early 2020, declaring his intentions to move to Ireland and play for the national team. He went on the Ireland Wolves\ tour to Namibia early that year, and impressed sufficiently to win a place in the squad for a three-match ODI series in England in July.Thrown straight into the side, Campher made half-centuries in his first two international innings, and dismissed Tom Banton with his fourth ball on debut - whom he had previously trapped lbw while playing against him for South Africa U-19s. He also took a couple of wickets in the famous Irish victory in the third match of the series, and was immediately a fixture in the one-day side. He\s a great person to captain, said Andy Balbirnie.Campher, a diminutive seam-bowling allrounder, has ambitions to move up the order and bat in the top six. He moved to Munster Reds ahead of the 2021 domestic season after playing for Leinster Lightning in his first summer as an adopted Irishman, though ankle surgery provided a setback. It was Niall O\Brien, the long-standing Ireland wicketkeeper, who first discovered that Campher qualified - thanks to his grandmother, who was brought up in Derry - while chatting to him during a warm-up match for the 2019 World Cup Qualifier.ESPNcricinfo staff"

He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasnt until 2018 that he really broke through. Salt smashed two Championship hundreds from the top of the order - including 148 off 138 balls against Derbyshire - and a strike-rate of 172 in the Blast helped Sussex to the Blast final, which they might well have won but for his calamitous run out in the second over. He was talent-spotted by Lahore Qalandars, who invited him to play in the Abu Dhabi T20 trophy - a Champions League-lite - but Islamabad United swooped to sign him in the PSL draft instead. 2019 brought two more Championship hundreds, but again it was against the white ball that he impressed the most, smashing a ton in the One-Day Cup and finishing the Blast as Sussexs leading run-scorer. He answered a phone call from the Barbados Tridents from a Miami beach in October, and was soon flying into Trinidad to play in the CPL final - he made a duck, but lifted the trophy regardless. He also became a regular member of Adelaide Strikers BBL squad, playing under his Sussex coach Jason Gillespie.The following summer might well have brought him an England debut after he smashed a 58-ball hundred against Ireland in a warm-up game at the Ageas Bowl but they stuck with their tried-and-tested openers and he returned to Sussex for the rest of the season. A winter away with Adelaide and Islamabad brought him limited success as teams worked out his vulnerability against legspin and when he returned to the UK, a freak cycling accident ruled him out of the early rounds of the Championship season. 2021 came to an end without him playing a single red-ball game and coincided with a move that felt like a homecoming: after spending midsummer playing for Manchester Originals in the Hundred, he signed a three-year deal with Lancashire as a replacement for Alex Davies.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

And it\s true that Ben Stokes\ combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted England to another level. Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins.For Stokes, this was a wonderful moment of redemption because it had been his misfortune until then to be remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team\s vice-captaincy. It was testament to his immense character that he ensured he would be remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England\s 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes\ attitude as exemplary, saying he had learned his lesson. The World Cup final underlined his immense character. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field, he had attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge from the outset. He had satisfied them.Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent\s Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England\s limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons.Stokes\ performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott\s untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England\s general demeanour throughout the tour.But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord\s Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow.Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord\s, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record.An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent. \nESPNcricinfo staff"

An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabis rise, like Afghanistans, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICCs World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage.Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khans academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistans erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gattings eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistans progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI.Nabi has remained the backbone of the side that qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and, recently, the 2015 World Cup. Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistans captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup. He has overseen rapid changes in Afghanistans cricket but has remained calmer than most. Nabi has also played club and domestic cricket in England, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where he has enjoyed varying success but has gained in experience.Liam Brickhill"

His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrongun either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasnt helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. Hes also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career.Shadab has made an immediate impact; he only played his maiden first-class game ten months ago, in July 2016. His ability with the U-19 side caught PSL franchise Islamabad Uniteds eye, who gave the young leggie a chance he accepted with aplomb. His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistans limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies. His meteoric rise continued as he flourished in the first two T20Is, taking seven wickets for 21 runs and winning the Man-of-the-Match award on both occasions."

In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker\s end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. He made his international debut in a Twenty20 international on New Zealand\s tour to South Africa in 2012-13, following some impressive performances in the shorter formats in the domestic season. Neesham began his first-class career with Auckland, but a move Otago worked well for him, as he made some important contributions in the 50-over format in the 2011-12 season, making three 40-plus scores in seven innings, all of them coming at more than a run a ball. He was among the wickets too, taking a career-best 5 for 44 against Wellington and 4 for 23 against Canterbury. The rewards came soon, as he was included in the limited-overs squads for the tour to South Africa and made his T20I and ODI debuts. In February 2014, Neesham made a century on Test debut against India and was at the other end when skipper Brendon McCullum became the first Black Cap to score a Test triple century. He became just the eighth player in Test history to score hundreds in his first two Tests when he made a century against West Indies in Jamaica.He narrowly missed the cut for the home World Cup in 2015, an experience he described as gut-wrenching, when Grant Elliott was preferred at the last minute. Neesham found himself in the stands at Eden Park as Elliott struck that iconic six against South Africa to secure a spot in the final.Neesham was part of the one-day side over the next two seasons but was dropped after the 2017 Champions Trophy. He was ready to retire but was talked out of it and asked instead to take a break from the game. He returned in 2018 and dominated domestic one-day cricket scoring 503 runs at an average of 62.87 with a strike rate of 110.79, which earned him an international recall to face Sri Lanka. He made 47 not out from 13 balls and 64 from 37 in his first two ODIs back in January 2019 and locked up his 2019 World Cup spot.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

Powells maiden ODI hundred, against Ireland in 2018, helped West Indies to a crucial win in the World Cup qualifier, and he captained a weakened side in Bangladesh later that year, but was left out of the squad for the World Cup itself, in 2019.He has been a consistent performer for Jamaica in white-ball cricket, with runs from the middle order, and captained the Tallawahs franchise in the 2020 CPL. He was Player of the Match in the final of the inaugural Abu Dhabi T10 League in 2018, hitting 61 not out off 25 balls for the victorious Northern Warriors.In 2022, at the start of a year in which he got an extended run in the West Indies T20I side, he made 107 off 53 balls against England at home and a few games later, 68 and 61 against India and Bangladesh away, both unbeaten. He also played every game in his first IPL season for Delhi Capitals, teeing off sharply from the lower middle-order to produce an impressive run of scores."
Glenn Maxwell,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316657.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example -appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwells audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. In 2017 he made his first Test hundred, against India in Ranchi. He was subsequently briefly dropped from the ODI side but came back and made his third T20I century in Bangalore early in 2019 to help Australia chase 191. The ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE that followed was a high point as well.Late in 2019, Maxwell took a mental-health break from the game. The time away, along with conversations about his role with white-ball captain Aaron Finch, helped revive his form - he made five scores of over 45 in six ODI innings in 2020, had an impressive IPL season with Royal Challengers Bangalore the following year, and in January 2022, became the first batter to breach the 150-run mark in a BBL innings. However, he made little impact in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups.He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australias one-day domestic history, and transferred that talent to the international stage. At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in Sydney, then the fastest for Australia in ODIs, and the second-quickest in World Cup history. Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia strove in vain to turn their disastrous series around. He was dropped following the 2017 tour of Bangladesh."

He got admitted to the BCBs pace foundation and soon caught the coaches attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh As tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armers offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haques dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladeshs first-ever ODI series win over India.He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizurs first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.

A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladeshs Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016.By November 2014, Nazmul had made his first-class debut for Rajshahi and the following year made his maiden first-class century. In the 2016 Dhaka Premier League, where he had his first taste of real competition in the domestic system, he made 537 runs at 41.30. But it was his 2016 Under-19 World Cup exploits - 259 runs at 64.75 - that grabbed the selectors attention and led them to pick him for the senior teams training camp in Sydney ahead of their 2016-17 New Zealand tour. With Mominul Haque ruled out with a rib injury on the day before the second Test in Christchurch, Nazmul was drafted in to the playing XI, becoming the 84th Bangladeshi to play Test cricket.Mohammad Isam"

In 2013 he was on the books at Nottinghamshire and scored 47 in his only senior game, against Bangladesh A. He was later a part of the MCC Young Cricketers Programme at Lords for two years and had other trials around the county scene with Durham, Essex and Kent, but didnt make it in English first-class cricket.Despite that lack of success, Cross is considered arguably the finest pure wicketkeeper of his era in Associate cricket. His leg-side stumping of Englands James Taylor standing up to the medium pace of Josh Davey at the 2015 World Cup was the first of many highlight-reel-worthy dismissals.If theres a blemish on Cross CV, his batting record at times appears underwhelming for a player of his calibre, especially one who has spent a significant chunk of time opening the batting. His high-water mark came in 2018, when he made twin hundreds against UAE and a rollicking 48 off 39 balls - including ten fours -  that helped kickstart Scotlands historic ODI victory over No. 1-ranked England at the Grange. But that innings in some ways sums up much of Cross Scotland career with the bat, which has often been good but rarely great.  He was named vice-captain in 2022, and when Richie Berrington suffered a hand injury against New Zealand during the home summer Cross made his Scotland captaincy debut in a stand-in capacity on his home ground in Aberdeen in August during an ODI tri-series against the UAE and USA."
Calum MacLeod,Scotland,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316597.png",Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium fast, Right arm Offbreak",Top order Batter,"Calum MacLeod won a place in Scottish sport folklore when he struck a century that helped Scotland beat the worlds No. 1 ODI side at the time, England, in a game in Edinburgh in 2018. That year, he also produced an unbeaten 157 against Afghanistan in a World Cup Qualifier match in Bulawayo, where he expertly dealt with legspinner Rashid Khan, liberally employing a sweep shot that he put down to his time spent playing hockey. Those knocks made him a slam-dunk choice at the end of 2018 to claim the ICC Associate Player of the Year Award, making him the second Scotland player to do so following Preston Mommsen in 2014. When MacLeod acted as a substitute fielder for England in an Ashes Test in 2009 he became the first Gaelic speaker to appear in a Test. That year, his hopes of forging a county career as a fast bowler fell apart when his action was reported after an Intercontinental Cup match. Remedial work followed, including sessions with Allan Donald, then bowling coach at Warwickshire, but he was released by the county in 2010. Nevertheless, hours spent watching the preparations of Warwickshires England duo, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, proved to be of benefit. Cricket Scotland had introduced player contracts at the end of 2008, and gradually MacLeod, who had briefly wondered about taking up hockey, surprised everyone by forcing his way into the side as a batter.Two MacLeod centuries in succession in January 2014 - a 62-ball 113 against UAE and 175 against Canada - played a major part in Scotlands qualification for the 2015 World Cup. Durham were impressed enough to offer him a contract, as a T20 player first and then across formats, and he helped win them the Royal London One-Day Cup that year. In 2018, Derbyshire signed him up in T20, and they benefited from a 58-ball hundred against Northamptonshire. MacLeods run-making - exactly 4000 runs in List A cricket for Scotland and more than 4300 overall - has often come in bursts: his limited-overs average for Scotland of 32.52 is not in the countrys top ten, yet he is comfortably top of the heap when it comes to List A and ODI hundreds made for the side. He was in sizzling ODI form over the home summer of 2022, making six scores of 50-plus in nine innings and finishing with an unbeaten hundred against USA at Aberdeen in what would be his final innings on home soil. Seemingly with several prime years left, he retired out of the blue at 33 in November that year, following Scotlands exit from the T20 World Cup in Australia."

In 2019-20, he proved his red-ball credentials, snaring 36 wickets in the regional four-day competition for Trinidad and Tobago, and chipping in with some useful runs from the lower-middle order.

He first came to attention in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, after which he was the leading run-scorer in the South African first-class competition in 2009-10, with 1189 runs at 66.05. But though he went on to average over 40 in first-class cricket in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, he was unable to break into to the Test team. Eventually, in August 2014, Rossouw was included in a South Africa ODI squad, but he had a nightmarish start in international cricket, racking up four ducks in his first six innings. The selectors, though, stuck with him and he was included in the T20 squad for the Australia tour in November 2014, where he scored 78 in his first match. Two months on, Rossouw made his first international century, against West Indies in Johannesburg, in the match where AB de Villiers broke the record for fastest ODI hundred, and he averaged 52 in the six games he played in the ODI World Cup that followed. In October 2016 he hit a sensational 122 to secure a 5-0 ODI series win over Australia, but he announced early the next year that he had signed for Hampshire as a Kolpak. He made an immediate impact in England, smashing a career-best 156 against Somerset in the Royal London Cup. Rossouw became a man in demand on the franchise T20 circuit at the tail end of the 2010s and into the next decade, finishing the 2018-19 Bangladesh Premier League as the leading run-scorer, with 558 runs. He won the Pakistan Super League with Quetta in 2019 and two years later with Multan Sultans; in 2022 he made 275 runs as Sultans made it to the final again and lost.Later that year, the UK having exited the European Union, Rossouw, no longer able to qualify to play county cricket other than as an overseas player, returned to South Africa colours. He did so with a bang, making an unbeaten 96 and two back-to-back T20I hundreds as their No. 3 in his first few innings back, against England, India and Bangladesh - the last of those in the World Cup, where South Africa eventually endured a shock exit at the hands of Netherlands."

Kane Williamson,New Zealand,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316618.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand\s greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game\s most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.Williamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand\s Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly.He was modest about his skills, too, - Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I\m not one of them, - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too.At the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson\s hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours.Williamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation. Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.In 2018, Williamson led New Zealand to two famous Test series wins. In April, he became the fourth New Zealand captain to win a series against England. In December, he was the chief architect of New Zealand\s first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, with 89 and 139 in the final Test. He became the first New Zealander to score 20 Test centuries in 2019 with an unbeaten double century against Bangladesh at home. But he elevated himself into the global pantheon of greats at the 2019 World Cup, where he was not only named player of the tournament but he carried himself with unprecedented class as the trophy was snatched from New Zealand\s hands by England in the greatest final of all time. He made two match-winning centuries against South Africa and West Indies and a vital 67 in a famous semi-final win against India to get New Zealand to a second successive World Cup final. His captaincy and calmness among the mayhem of a tied final and tied Super Over was extraordinary. His conduct in the aftermath having lost the Cup on a one-off tie-break provision where the team with the most boundaries wins, was even more incredible.\nAlagappan Muthu"

He led the country to their first appearance in an Under-19 World Cup semi-final in February 2016, before making the year more memorable with his Test debut, against England in October.He is a batting allrounder who bowls right-arm offspin with a quiet action where he trundles to the wicket before giving a slight leap before rotating his upper body. It is a beautifully simple action that has yielded him many wickets in the U-19 and first-class level.Born in Barisal, Mehedi grew up in Daulatpur in the outskirts of Khulna city. He learned offspin from Sheikh Salahuddin, the former Bangladesh player regarded as the best offspinner of his generation. Salahuddin passed away in October 2013. Mehedi spent two years at the U-19 level, captaining Bangladesh to the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. He made his first-class debut in the 2014-15 National Cricket League but it was the next seasons tournament when he really made a mark. Mehedi took 30 wickets at 16.43, including three five-fors. He was a star in the 2016 U-19 World Cup, with his spirit coming through as a standout part of his character.\nMohammad Isam"

To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as Indias most successful Test captain.  Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was a genuine threat to Sachin Tendulkars record of 49 ODI and 51 Test hundreds. An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be Indias next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. Kohli was quite simply Indias most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian crickets biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him."

Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young. A reliable batsman and a steady medium-pacer - both suits being works in progress - Holder was born in Barbados and was the recipient of the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009. He played one first-class game before being called up for the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where he was his team\s leading wicket-taker with 13 wickets. He replaced the injured Tino Best for West Indies\ limited-overs leg of the Bangladesh tour in 2011, and made his international debut in Australia a few months later. A Test debut came against New Zealand in Bridgetown in June 2014, and he took two wickets and made a fighting 52 at No. 7. He had been signed by Chennai Super Kings in the 2013 IPL auction, but was dropped. However, in 2016, he was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders.At 6 feet and seven inches tall, Holder is a soft-spoken man, and so there were questions over his ability to lead a team of older and vastly more experienced cricketers. His maiden Test century - against England in April 2015 - showcased his mental strength. West Indies were 189 for 6 when he came in to bat at No. 8 and his 214-minute defiance saved the match for his team. On a tour of Australia in 2015-16, his authority seemed to come into question when stories of his bowlers refusing to bowl into the wind surfaced, but Holder quashed them on Twitter saying, Be careful what you read! My fast bowlers had a tough game but every time I called on them they came up and gave effort. Never once refused!He captained West Indies in the 2015 World Cup, where they won three out of seven matches. He was also part of the squad that won the 2016 World T20, though he didn\t play a game.

Chakabva represented Zimbabwe in the Afro-Asia Under-19 Cup in 2005, but despite the rebel crisis and subsequent player drain, had to queue up behind the likes of Tatenda Taibu, Brendan Taylor and Richmond Mutumbami for a place in the senior sides. Though he had a disappointing run during the Pakistan Cricket Academys visit in 2008, he was included in Zimbabwes squad for their trip to Canada soon afterwards and made his international debut in a T20I against Pakistan in King City. His ODI debut came a week later back in Africa, in the Kenya Tri-Nation tournament, against the hosts.In 2011, Chakabva made it into the Test XI for the one-off Test against New Zealand in November, but the pivotal point in his career came two years later. In a Logan Cup match against Mid West Rhinos, he cruised to an almost chanceless 240 - his first double-hundred, and the third-highest individual score in the history of the tournament. A grade cricket contract with Farleigh Magpies in Queensland, Australia, followed, marking the beginning of a bountiful year in 2014, in the course of which Chakabva added three more hundreds for Mashonaland Eagles before the end of the season. He was one of the few bright points of Zimbabwes tour of Bangladesh late that year, with a maiden Test century and two fifties. In the two landmark white-ball home series against Bangladesh in 2022, both of which Zimbabwe won, Chakabva starred with his first ODI hundred, in a game where he and Sikandar Raza rescued their team from 49 from 4 to take them to a win in a chase of 291. Chakabva served as Zimbabwe white-ball captain for a spell in 2022, including in the ODI in Townsville where they beat Australia for the first time in any format."

After making his debut against South Africa in September 2022, Brook travelled to Pakistan and New Zealand with Ben Stokes team, where he peeled off consecutive scores of 153, 87, 9, 111, 89, 54, and 186 to take his overall tally to 809 runs in nine innings, at an extraordinary strike-rate of 98.77. No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brooks anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in Englands thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement. By then, Brook was also a T20 World Cup winner, after featuring in Englands triumph in Australia earlier in the winter, and at the IPL auction in December, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 13.25 crore (£1.3 million).A former England U19s captain, Brook had flickered in Yorkshire colours over the first couple of years of his professional career, most notably when scoring a maiden first-class hundred at Chelmsford in 2018, as the visitors recovered from being bowled out for 50 in their first innings to inflict defeat on reigning champions Essex. He recorded a List A hundred at the start of Yorkshires 2019 Royal London Cup campaign, and showed signs of greater consistency the following summer when he averaged 43.00 in the Bob Willis Trophy.But his form in the Blast - first as a finisher in 2020, then shifting up to No. 4 in 2021 - was enough for him to be touted as a future England player, and an innings of 62 from 31 balls in the Northern Superchargers first Hundred game led Stokes to echo that sentiment. He is particularly strong against seamers, hitting down the ground, or over midwicket and the covers, and has become innovative too, reverse-lapping and scooping in the death overs.Brook, an orderly young batsman, won 1st XI recognition midway through 2017 courtesy of an impressive run of scores in the second team, the highlight of which was a matchwinning century in a one-day final against Middlesex at Headingley. A product of the Burley-in-Wharfedale club, and Sedburgh School, Brook had already toured India with England Under-19s at that stage and he captained them later in the year in 50-over cricket in the return series against the Indians.He led from the front, initially at least, at the 2018 U19 World Cup, where he finished as Englands leading run-scorer. But he made a golden duck in the quarter-final defeat to Australia and was then dropped for their final game, a seventh-place play-off against New Zealand, for disciplinary reasons.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africas first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer.In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharajs secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.During the opening first-class match of the 2016-17 season, Maharaj picked up 13 for 157, and was then told he would be on South Africas Test tour to Australia. Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side. He took 3 for 56 in the first innings, four in the match, and scored an unbeaten 41 to show great promise for the future.Firdose Moonda"

He deposited the second ball, from Chris Morris, over midwicket for six and never looked back.A bludgeoning left-hand batter with power and panache, Malan was born in Roehampton but brought up in South Africa. He made his first-class debut for Boland in 2005-06. In 2006 he played 2nd XI cricket for Middlesex and Worcestershire, having made his first-team debut for Middlesex in front of 20,000 people in a T20 Cup match at The Oval. As a 20-year-old in 2008, he came in at No. 6 for Middlesex to hit a brilliant unbeaten hundred in a T20 quarter-final against a Lancashire attack containing Andrew Flintoff, Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork. Malan made his Test debut a month after his first T20I, but his first five Tests, against South Africa and West Indies, were far from exceptional, with an average of 23. However, England calculated he possessed fortitude, and at 30, the know-how to handle an Ashes series in Australia. He did exactly that by scoring Englands first hundred of that 2017-18 series after they got to the WACA 2-0 down. It was a tough, grown-up innings at a time when England had to answer charges of off-field immaturity. But he was dropped from the Test side after three poor matches in the 2018 summer and it took him three years to make a comeback. Towards the end of 2019, he won a place in Englands T20I squad touring New Zealand, and recorded Englands fastest century in the format at the time - a 48-ball century in Napier, which played a significant role in the 3-2 series scoreline.He was one of the leading run-scorers in T20Is in 2020 and his half-centuries in South Africa, including an unbeaten 99, took England to No. 1 in the format at the end of the year. Malan himself was the reigning batter in T20Is when he got his Test recall in 2021. But although he was one of three England batters, along with Joe Root and Ben Stokes, to score at least two half-centuries in the Ashes that winter, he was dropped from the side after England lost the series 4-0.Malan topped the run-scoring charts in the 2022 Hundred, making 377 runs at a strike rate of 167 in a title-winning campaign for Trent Rockets, and though he missed the 2022 T20 World Cup final through injury, he picked up a winners medal that winter, as England became the first mens team to hold both the 50- and 20-over titles concurrently."

Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015. A maiden five-wicket haul for Durham against Lancashire in Chester-le-Street the following year added to the good impression he had built at Ireland Under-19 level and during a spell with the Australian grade side Randwick-Petersham. When Ireland were granted Test status, McCarthy was ambitious to become a central part of Ireland\s Test side, but he was bitterly disappointed to miss out on selection for their inaugural Test against Pakistan. He was released by Durham at the end of that 2018 summer.His sister, Louise McCarthy, has also represented Ireland Women.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

Rahul was a part of Indias squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnatakas Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian crickets most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in Indias Test squad on their tour of Australia.A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batsman from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy"

He began to feature more regularly from 2019 onwards, as one of a number of promising young Irish seamers coming through at the same time, and was awarded an emerging player contract that year.In 2020, he was key performer in Irelands T20I victory against West Indies in the Caribbean, taking 3 for 29 while defending 208, and took five wickets in two ODIs against England later that year.ESPNcricinfo staff"

It took the exposure of the PSL for Asif Ali to come to prominence in an Islamabad United side that owed much to him for their title-winning campaign in 2018. A six in a Super Over against Mustafizur Rahman got their campaign up and running, and it wasnt until he smashed three sixes in arrow in a nerve-wracking chase that his side were assured victory. Those heroics saw him called up to the national side for three T20Is against West Indies, where he made the step-up with consummate ease. Clear about his role in the team, hes already played several vital cameos in the shortest format to get his side over the line, with a strike rate around 160 proof of his comfort at the highest level. As a finisher in ODI cricket, he similarly impresses, although he may have to move lower down the order if Pakistans middle order fragility continues; his power hitting exploits are not best suited for the No. 6 position. But whats most important is he fills a very specific need within the team, and if the first few months are anything to go by, he fills it very well indeed. Given he is 26 and has a strike rate above 140 in 88 T20s, it does seem a bit of a scouting failure Asif wasnt given a promotion to the national side a few years earlier, when much of Pakistans struggles in T20 and ODI cricket were to do with lack of firepower in the death overs. It bodes well for Pakistan hes hit the ground running, eager to make up for lost time. Danyal Rasool"

Jordans career looked to be going nowhere at the end of 2012 when he was released by Surrey, but he made his international debut less than a year later. He enjoyed a run in Englands white-ball sides in the games following the 2013-14 Ashes tour, and was given a Test debut the following summer.He played only twice in the ignominious 2015 World Cup, but had shown enough promise in an England shirt to survive the cull following that tournament. He lost his place in the ODI squad in 2016, but was impressive in the World T20 in India that year: but for Carlos Brathwaites last-gasp heroics, the fact he went for only eight runs in the 19th over of the final would surely have been remembered more fondly.Jordan remained a lock in England T20I team, and his performance in a series in the Caribbean immediately before the 2019 World Cup nearly brought him in from the wilderness. But his close friend Jofra Archer was named in the eventual squad ahead of him, and he continued to forge a path on the global franchise circuit.Jordan, a right-arm quick bowler born in the home of fast bowling, Barbados, was first spotted in his native land by Bill Athey, who was scouting for a recipient of a cricket scholarship back in England at Dulwich College. He became an exciting prospect at Surrey but failed to emerge as the bowler the county had hoped, not helped by a troubled period in the countys affairs.Jordan was earmarked for great things after Nadeem Shahid, Surreys Second XI coach, saw five minutes of his all-round ability. Shahid immediately called then first XI coach Alan Butcher to tell him they had a gem on their books. Five days later Jordan was at first-team nets. He impressed there and blazed into Surreys team in August 2007, looking the part immediately at just 18 years old. It was a hugely promising start with 20 wickets at 24.50 before the year was out but in the following seasons, injuries and inconsistency stalled his career and he missed the whole of 2010 with a back problem. His return in 2011 produced only 11 wickets at 48.00 in the Championship but that winter returned to play for Barbados and his potential was again evident. But back with Surrey in 2012 his impact was minimal and he was released at the end of the season. He went back to Barbados, with the question looming of who he might play for internationally, and excelled again. A move to Sussex in 2013 saw his true potential come to the fore, and England soon took notice. Eligible for England through his grandmother, he was selected for two England Lions fixtures in 2013 - meaning he would have to undertake a qualifying period to play for West Indies - and travelled with the full England ODI squad to Dublin. An ODI debut at the Ageas Bowl against Australia soon followed, before he broke through on the post-Ashes tour that winter. He continued to impress with the ball for Sussex across formats, and has played T20 cricket in the majority of leagues around the world, including the IPL. A useful lower-order batsman, Jordan hit a maiden first-class ton against Essex at Colchester in 2016, and has regularly found himself clearing the ropes to bail England out of trouble. He is also a world-class fielder, whether called upon in the slips, in the outfield, or off his own bowling. ESPNcricinfo staff"

He was largely picked on his promise. One of the fastest bowlers in Sri Lankas system, Kumara possesses a sharp bouncer, and an ability to both swing and seam the ball - all allied to a bustling intensity.He had played in the Under-19 World Cup in February, but it was on a u-19 tour of England that he put himself into contention for higher honours. He took a series-high 13 wickets at an average of 18.30 through the Youth Tests, and was especially effective at Northampton, where he claimed first-innings figures of 7 for 82, then a further 4 for 52 in the second innings to send England Under-19s to their first home defeat in six years.Injury layoffs for Dushmantha Chameera, Nuwan Pradeep and Dhammika Prasad then opened up a spot for Kumara in the Test team.

He bounced back later that year with an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second-highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer in which he received the Allan Border Medal.Prior to his ban, Warner had established himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world. In 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides, and he led the limited-overs sides with great success when Smith was rested. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching Englands Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It completed a remarkable rise for a player who burst onto the international scene in 2008-09 as a T20 specialist - he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on T20I debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well.His debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No. 2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second game he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did, carrying his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batting. Later that same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball one against India at the WACA. In the seven-year period between his debut and the ban, Warner was far and away the best Test opener in the world.Away from international cricket, he has had a prolific franchise T20 career, especially in the IPL, and in 2021 became just the fourth batter to pass 10,000 runs in T20."

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australias attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australias defence ended in the semi-finals.His challenge has been to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball, although overall his Test career numbers are also outstanding. He struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes. He took his 200th Test wicket in his 50th Test in February of 2019 joining an elite group of Australian bowlers although play only one of the five Ashes Tests in the 2019 series. When England toured down under in 2021-22, Starc produced some of his best form in the three matches where the series was decided and went on to claim the Allan Border Medal as Australias male player of the year.Also a powerful lower-order batter, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013. He is married to Australia wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy.ESPNcricinfo staff"

An all-round performance of 60 runs and a four-for for Rawalpindi against Sialkot in an inter-region Under-16 tournament in 2008 earned him a place in the Pakistan side for the International Under-15 Championship in the West Indies. On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. Nawaz studied at the FG Boys School in Rawalpindi but chose to discontinue his college education to focus on cricket instead. In the first four seasons after his first-class debut in 2012, Nawaz scored three first-class centuries and seven half-centuries, tallying 1440 runs, and took 44 wickets at an average of 24.4. Nawaz played for Quetta Gladiators in the inaugural Pakistan Super League and finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with 13 dismissals. That performance earned him a place in Pakistans T20 squad for the 2016 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. A few months later, he was picked in the ODI side for the tour of England and Ireland. Umar Farooq"

Bavuma combined playing for his school with a commitment to Soweto Cricket Club, where he was mentored by Geoffrey Toyana from a young age.At 18, he made his first-class debut for Gauteng and three seasons later was playing in the franchise team, Lions. His sound technique, particularly off the back foot, helped him average over 45 in his second summer and he also demonstrated a temperament beyond his years. Bavuma established himself as part of the Lions leadership group, and was named their vice-captain in 2013-14.

Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighbourhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded. Signs of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year-old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.The transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand\s irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side\s march to their first World Cup final in 2015. Boult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn\t move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand\s top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL.Boult\s strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, he\s got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control. Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side\s most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. The pair have both raced past 200 Test wickets and by 2019 occupy third and fourth on New Zealand\s all-time Test wicket-taking list behind Hadlee and Daniel Vettori. Boult was again magnificent in the 2019 World Cup helping lead New Zealand\s attack taking 17 wickets. He took a hat-trick against Australia, and the key wicket of Virat Kohli in the semi-final win over India. He bowled the last over and the Super Over in the tied final against England and without some misfortune he may have won the World Cup for his nation. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.ESPNcricinfo staff"
Craig Ervine,Zimbabwe,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316567.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Few people in Zimbabwe cricket circles were surprised when Craig Ervine found his way into Zimbabwe colours. A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshires middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.But it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his familys living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervines recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.After spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwes squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. Ervines returns from Zimbabwes trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwes squad for that tournament.Liam Brickhill"

He played four Championship matches in 2015, accounting for an England opener, Sam Robson, on his debut. A Scotland debut, at 19, followed in 2016, a year in which his experience was also developed with eight further Championship matches. It felt like a breakthrough season, not just for an exceptional last over in the televised T20 win against Sussex but also his six wickets against Notts at Trent Bridge and a 4 for 39 in the final Championship match against Durham with relegation staring Hampshire in the face. But it proved to be something of a false dawn. After a quiet 2017, Wheal missed most of the 2018 season with a stress fracture in his spine, and his recovery kept him out for much of the following campaign.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

It wasnt plain sailing: that he played any international cricket at all is a credit to his mental toughness - at 16, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and required two cycles of chemotherapy to defeat the illness.He moved from Hobart to Melbourne when he realised he would be stuck behind Tim Paine in the Tasmania wicketkeeping queue. Victoria gave him a chance and he grabbed it, making 83 and taking six catches on his first-class debut. Wade would later become a Sheffield Shield-winning captain for Victoria, leading them to two titles in their hat-trick of wins between 2015 and 2017.Though he showed promise early in his Test career, including two hundreds in his first ten Tests, there was too much competition for the wicketkeeping spot. When his childhood friend Paine was handed the job for the 2017-18 Ashes, it looked like Wade had missed the bus, but he moved back to Tasmania, dominated state cricket for two seasons, and earned a spot for the 2019 series against England - in which he scored two centuries. That was followed by a return to the Australia white-ball set-ups. A brief, successful, stint as T20I opener in David Warners absence, on the back of dominant BBL seasons as an opener with Hobart Hurricanes, made Wade Australias first-choice T20I wicketkeeper in 2020-21, and he also captained the T20I team in two series while Aaron Finch was out. He was vice-captain for the 2021 T20 World Cup, and recast as a finisher. And it was in that role that he delivered arguably the most important innings of the T20 World Cup, in the semi-final against Pakistan to get Australia home, after which they went on to take the title."

With Denesh Ramdin representing West Indies in all three formats, and Andre Fletcher also in the limited-overs mix, West Indies have used Charles second skill sparingly.Charles power-hitting came to the fore when he muscled 52 off 36 balls against India, setting up West Indies win over India in the World T20 semi-final in Mumbai in 2016. After the tournament-winning victory, St Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony announced that Charles would have a grandstand named after him at Beausejour Stadium, now Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium.Charles also showed sparks of brilliance during his 84 against England in Pallekele in 2012, and 57 against Australia in Brisbane in 2013. Charles knock helped West Indies secure their first win over Australia in any format for 16 years.

Afif is also the youngest T20 debutant to take a five-for - he was 17 years and 72 days when he picked up 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, for Rajshahi Kings against Chittagong Vikings in December 2016."

His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batters under pressure with his speed through the air, like his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is an accurate googly, and he has variations aplenty. With bat in hand he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings, and he has airbrushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. Rashid was just 17 when he made his ODI debut on Afghanistans tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. Less than two years later, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL for close to US$600,000. After a superb 17-wicket first season with them, he picked up franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - for whom he took the first-ever hat-trick in the CPL in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won his (and their) first BBL title in 2018. He scaled new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive, and later in 2017, taking his country to a win over West Indies in their first ODI in the Caribbean with 7 for 18. He was duly honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. The following year, he became the youngest cricketer to top the ODI bowling rankings, the youngest man to captain an international side, and the fastest to 100 ODI wickets.In Afghanistans inaugural year in Test cricket, Rashid took five second-innings wickets in their first win, against Ireland, and six months later made an important fifty and took twin five-fors, finishing with 11 wickets in a famous win over Bangladesh in Chattogram. In 2021, he took 11 again, this time in a win over Zimbabwe. In his five seasons with Sunrisers, he was a totemic presence, taking 93 wickets at an economy rate of 6.33. When he moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, he took 19 wickets in a run that led the side to the title."

Playing in just his third ODI, in 2020, Tector produced an ice-cool 29 not out off 26 balls to help secure a famous win chasing 329 with a ball to spare. Paul Stirlings and Andy Balbirnies hundreds may have taken the headlines on the day, but Tectors poise gave hope that Ireland may have found a cure for the middle-order ills that had plagued them following multiple retirements toward the end of the 2010s. After a string of 20s and 30s against lesser opposition, Tector showed signs that he performs better on a bigger stage after he made 79 off 68 balls to help take Ireland to their first ever ODI win over South Africa, in July 2021. Since then, he hasnt looked back, making three fifties in Jamaica in an ODI series win over West Indies to start 2022. That run came in a stretch of nine ODI innings where he made seven scores of over 50, the last two of them hundreds against New Zealand. In between whiles he also made an unbeaten 64 off 33 balls in a rain-shortened T20 against India at Malahide.

But it took four innings in Tests before these skills were visible.Delayed gratification has been a theme of Brooks career. As a teenager, he was part of two Under-19 World Cup squads, even captaining West Indies in the 2008 edition. But he found it hard to take to first-class cricket. Brooks wanted to be an electrical engineer if not a cricketer, a switch that might have played on his mind when he was dropped by Barbados in 2012, having made only one fifty after his debut in 2007.His comeback for Barbados was as boisterous as his exit had been tame. In 2015, Brooks made 124 against Windward Islands in his first innings back, followed it up with two more hundreds in the same year, and was immediately back in the West Indies plans with a Board Presidents XI call-up against Australia.But it wasnt until 2018 when he seriously challenged for the senior side again. As West Indies A captain, he made 91 and 122* against India A during a tour of England, and two fifties against the same opponents a year later earned him a place in West Indies squad for the home series against India.Varun Shetty"

Although less heralded at the time, Ackermann was a former South Africa U-19 who had topped the Sunfoil averages in 2016-17, and might have been in contention for a Test call-up had he not taken the well-trodden English county route.His returns in county cricket were mostly solid rather than spectacular, and when he did grab the headlines it was with his occasional offspin - figures of 7 for 18 in a T20 Blast game against Birmingham Bears making him the first man to take a seven-wicket haul in the format. He captained the T20 team in his first season at Leicestershire, taking on the job full-time the following year, and in 2019 stepped up to lead the 50-over side; as well as topping the run charts in both limited-overs formats. The following summer he was unveiled as club captain, a sign of his growing importance to the county, and in 2022 he made history as his career-best 277 not out helped Leicestershire to their highest first-class score, 756 for 4 dec, and a Championship-record fifth-wicket stand of 477 with Wiaan Mulder (235 not out)Ackermann had previous experience in the county of Leicestershire after enjoying a successful season for Kibworth in 2012. He is a product of Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, with whom he toured England. He was the leading run-scorer in the CSA Under-19 three-day competition in 2009, where he averaged 200 with two centuries.However, when his international debut did arrive in late 2019, it was in the orange of Netherlands, and he went on to help secure qualification for both the 2020 T20 World Cup (postponed to 2021) and the subsequent event in Australia in 2022, at which his unbeaten 41 was instrumental in one of the biggest shocks of the tournaments history, as his former countrymen South Africa were eliminated in a 13-run defeat in Adelaide.\nESPNCricinfo staff"

He first tasted success in franchise cricket with Titans in the 2007-08 season, when he topped the wicket-takers chart in the MTN Domestic Championship, finished third in the Standard Bank Pro20 Series, and contributed handy runs in both tournaments. Titans won both titles and van der Merwe harvested a clutch of player-of-the-year titles. The following season, his 30 wickets were pivotal in the team retaining the MTN title.He marked his T20I debut, against Australia in 2009 with a quickfire 48 and 1 for 30 and was named Player of the Match. He played 26 games, split evenly between ODIs and T20Is over a year, for South Africa before calling time on his international career with them. Between then and when he first turned out for Netherlands in 2015, having acquired a Dutch passport, he plied his trade as a T20 journeyman, with gigs in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, and with Somerset in Englands T20 Blast, while still appearing for Titans.Van der Merwe got off to a brisk start in T20Is for Netherlands, taking two wickets apiece in each of his first four games, in 2015. In June 2019, he produced a breakneck 75 not out against Zimbabwe, and in the game after, took 4 for 35 - though Zimbabwe won that match in the eliminator after it was tied.As he entered his late 30s, van der Merwe continued to ply his trade around the world, though primarily as a bowler as his batting became less consistent. At the T20 World Cup in 2022, playing for Netherlands, he took a stunning high catch off David Miller to help his side secure a famous victory - one which knocked his old team, South Africa, out of the tournament before the semi-finals.His longevity was confirmed when, in early 2023, he finished the inaugural SA20 as the leading wicket-taker for champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape.ESPNcricinfo staff"

He impressed one and all with his heavy run-scoring in school and age-group cricket. He was soon picked in Bangladeshs Under-19 side in 2012, the usual route for any talented young cricketer from BKSP and soon enough, he scored heavily in Youth ODIs too.

Over the next decade or so, Southee would go on to form one of the worlds best new-ball partnerships with Trent Boult, and would also come to be known for his ability to clear the fence. He hit his 50th six in only his 36th Test, and could one day take the Test record for most sixes from his long-time captain Brendon McCullum.Pace and outswing, however, are the main tools of Southees trade. His bag of 18 wickets at 17.33 in the 2011 World Cup prompted Allan Donald to say he had the potential to become the best swing bowler in the world, and though frequent injury-forced absences have kept him from fulfilling that prophecy, he has shown he can be devastating across a wide range of conditions.In 2012, he showed his adaptability in the subcontinent, picking up 7 for 64 in Bangalore, the best figures for a New Zealand bowler in India, before bowling his side to a rare win in Sri Lanka with match figures of 8 for 120 at the P Sara Oval. Two years later, his 11 wickets in the West Indies, at 21.09, helped New Zealand achieve their first series win away from home, against anyone other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, in 12 years. In ODIs, his landmark performance came at the 2015 World Cup, when he sliced through Englands batting with a sensational spell of swing bowling to finish with figures of 7 for 33, the best bowling figures for a New Zealander in ODIs.Such is his standing in New Zealand cricket, Southee was elevated as a stand in captain in a T20I in 2017 and then an ODI in 2018. But despite standing in as captain and remaining a key Test and T20 bowler, he fell out of favour in the ODI side due to the form of Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson and only played one match in the 2019 World Cup. \nESPNcricinfo staff"

His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy.

He had begun the season billed as the belligerent face of England\s next generation after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine.Crafting his game did not go well in 2018. He broke a thumb in the Roses match in July which did not help (bizarrely reappearing to bat with a short leg pad as protection) and failed to reach fifty in 10 Championship matches as Lancashire were relegated under his captaincy. He recovered in time for Finals Day in the T20 Blast where his hundred in 49 balls against Derbyshire had provided his greatest satisfaction in a summer he would want to forget.He gave up the captaincy at the end of the season and over the next three years embarked on a globe-trotting T20 journey, ticking off the majority of the world\s franchise leagues during English winters to expose himself to different conditions and roles. His form led to an ODI debut in early 2021 and a T20I recall exactly four years after his debut against Sri Lanka. The following month, he blitzed the fastest-ever T20I hundred by an Englishman, off 42 balls against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, then cleared the new stand at Headingley and embarked on a six-hitting rampage in the first season of the Hundred.Livingstone, a hard-hitting batsman from Barrow in Cumbria, won a trophy in his first season in Lancashire colours when they triumphed at Edgbaston on Finals Day in the 2015 NatWest Blast. His satisfaction did not come without mishap, however, after he was glassed (and deemed an innocent party) in a late-night incident in an Ashford bar after the quarter-final win against Kent and needed around 20 stitches. A first-ball duck, bowled by Northants\ Shahid Afridi, added to his misery in the final, but Lancashire were hopeful that, at the very least, they had a big hitter on their hands.He had first attracted media attention as the season began by striking 350 in 138 balls for his club side Nantwich in a mismatch which saw them beat Caldy by 500 runs. It was held to be one of the largest individual scores in any officially-sanctioned limited-overs fixture. He had moderate success in 2015-16 in Australian club cricket with Perth, but Lancashire\s coach, Ashley Giles, gave the 22-year-old opportunities in all formats and was rewarded when he topped Lancashire\s Championship batting averages, building on a maiden first-class hundred against Somerset in Taunton.  A 21-ball fifty against Yorkshire equalled what at the time was Lancashire\s quickest in Twenty20. England Lions\ interest was quickened and two intelligently-compiled hundreds in Sri Lanka spoke of a batsman more adaptable than many had imagined as well as one who possessed useful attributes as either legspinner or offspinner as the situation demanded.\nESPNcricinfo staff"
Mark Wood,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316660.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"It looked, for a while, as if Mark Wood would be another of those fast bowlers who promised more than they delivered.An apparently relentless succession of injuries - particularly injuries to his ankle - threatened to either end his career or turn him into another fast medium seamer who compromised his pace for a longer career in the game.But Wood was not to be denied. Abandoning a short run-up that was a characteristic of his career up until the latter part of 2018, Wood instead reasoned a longer approach to the crease would put less pressure on his body and allow him to hit the speeds his early career had promised.The results were dramatic. Returning to the England team for the final Test of the Caribbean tour in early 2019, Wood claimed a maiden five-wicket haul and generated speeds of around 95 mph in a remarkably hostile demonstration of fast bowling. Scyld Berry, the veteran Telegraph correspondent and a man believed to have seen more England Tests than anyone else, rated it the quickest spell he had ever seen by an England bowler.There was more to come. Recalled to the ODI side just before the World Cup, he went on to play a huge role in the teams eventual success. With Jofra Archer he traded records for the quickest deliveries of the tournament - both exceeded 95 mph - and, by offering pace and wicket-taking potential in the middle-overs, ensured his captain always had a potent weapon in the field. While Archer finished with more wickets (21 to Woods 18), Wood finished with the better strike-rate. Underlining his commitment to the cause, Wood sustained a serious sides strain during the final but, with the match in the balance, continued to bowl at high pace. He was subsequently ruled out of the Ashes series that followed.Wood never did fit the prototype of a modern England fast bowler. He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and, originally at least, bowled from a sprinters run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed Englands Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality.Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.Paul Collingwoods appetite for promoting and encouraging Durhams younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean.He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lords debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Woods workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Andersons side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn.He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durhams to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in Englands 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as Englands fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season.Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lords, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup.Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011. He made his List A debut against Northamptonshire in Clydesdale Bank 40 the following month and his first County Championship appearance against Nottinghamshire in August of the same year.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket. Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into Indias ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasnt misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham. Shamis quick promotion to international cricket was the result of impressive performances in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy: in five matches he took 28 wickets at 21.35, including two ten-wicket hauls, against Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. He has also enjoyed early success in the Twenty20 format, picking up 14 wickets in his first eight domestic Twenty20 games, and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2011 IPL season. He got his first game for them in 2013, and was acquired by Delhi Daredevils in 2014, who retained him in 2016 despite his missing the entire 2015 season with injury. ESPNcricinfo staff"

Born and raised in Oxford, Munsey had dreams of becoming a professional golfer and it was a golf scholarship to the Loretto School, just outside Edinburgh, that brought him to Scotland at age 13. However, Munseys self-realisation that he preferred a team environment over the individualistic nature of golf began to take shape while captaining the cricket team at the school. Upon graduation, he stayed in Edinburgh and continued to work his way up the ladder via club cricket. He made his T20I debut in 2015 against Ireland, and got his maiden international fifty a month later during the T20 World Cup Qualifier on home soil. Through the rest of the 2010s and into the 2020s, Munsey has been a dominant presence at the top of the order in Scotlands T20I side, constantly disrupting opposition bowling attacks with that reverse sweep. However, he showed he is more than just a one-trick pony at the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. With most teams having finally taken the time to scout him and plug that shot with multiple boundary riders behind point, Munsey went back to his golfing roots to drive his way to a pair of half-centuries, including one in a Player-of-the-Match performance to complete a famous upset win over West Indies. In the ODI side, Munsey bats lower down, taking on spinners in the middle overs where his plethora of sweeps continue to come in handy. But it doesnt mean he is any less potent and as a result he has proven he can be an effective finisher too, making him a versatile batting threat."

That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. A highly-rated graduate of Sri Lankas school cricket system, Mendis batting had earned him a large following long before he was on the national selectors radar.

Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WAs junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. Green didnt play any first-class cricket in 2017-18 and spent the 2018 winter at Cricket Australias National Performance Centre in Brisbane. His game went to another level in 2019-20 after another stress fracture in his lower back forced him to stop bowling again. He made his maiden first-class century, producing scores of 87* and 121* to force an extraordinary draw against Queensland at the Gabba. He would score two more centuries that summer before posting a career-best 197 from 438 balls against New South Wales in October 2020. That performance led to his first international call-up as he was named in Australias ODI and T20I squads to face a touring India side which was followed by a Test debut against the same opposition. He made half-centuries in each of his first four series then claimed a maiden five-wicket haul against South Africa the MCG in late 2022 - during a game where he badly broke his finger. Shortly after returning to side in India he made a maiden Test hundred in Ahmedabad.By then, his cross-format skills had caught the eye after a pair of dazzling T20I fifties in India led to a bidding war in the 2022 IPL auction where Green fetched AU$3.15million from Mumbai Indians.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

He had won his place on the back of some impressive form in regional cricket for Barbados, making his maiden professional hundreds in 2019-20. In the Regional Super50, he hit 113 from the middle order against the Leeward Islands, before finishing second to Jermaine Blackwood in the four-day run-scoring charts as Barbados cantered to the title.He demonstrated his power against seamers - though looked awkward against spin - in the 2020 CPL for Barbados Tridents, earning him a spot in the T20I side in late 2020. While his first two appearances did not go to plan, the withdrawal of several senior players gave him a chance in the Test and ODI squads in Bangladesh in early 2021.ESPNcricinfo staff"

But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket.He finished the series against the Bangladesh Under-19s in November 2009 as the leading wicket-taker, and represented Zimbabwe Under-19 at the World Cup in 2009-10 before making his senior Zimbabwe debut in the second Twenty20 against India at Harare in June 2010. There was a significant gap in his appearances for Zimbabwe thereafter, but he matured in the A side and in domestic cricket until 2013, when it became plainly apparent that he was one of the best quicks in the country. Chatara took 32 wickets in 18 international games in 2013 and his maiden Test five-for sealed the famous Test win over Pakistan. After Kyle Jarvis international retirement, Chris Mpofus fall down the pecking order, and Brian Vitoris susceptibility to injury, Chatara found himself Zimbabwes senior bowler in 2014 - a role he appeared to take to rather well.Liam Brickhill"
Mitchell Marsh,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316612.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Mitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, can bowl 140kph, and is a hard-hitting middle-order bat. He has been an alluring prospect for Australia but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage.Marsh was earmarked for high honours, alongside his brother Shaun, ever since he captained Australia Under-19s to victory in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He played state cricket at just 17, and made his T20I debut at 19 in 2011. He was also a promising junior Australian Rules footballer, and hails from a prolific sporting family - his father is Geoff Marsh, the Australia opener, and later coach and selector; his sister, Melissa, was a professional basketballer.In 2018, Marsh was appointed Australia Test vice-captain in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, but he was then dropped from all formats and lost his national contract due to a string of failures, at Test level in particular. In 2020 he returned to the T20I fold and the following year, starred on two tours of West Indies and Bangladesh and produced a stunning 77 not out off 50 balls in the T20 World Cup final, helping Australia to their maiden title.  Marsh made it to the Test side over Shane Watson on the 2015 Ashes tour and was given time to settle into the No. 6 role, although his bowling was arguably the stronger feature of his game at the time. That had not been the case in his debut Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE the previous year, when he scored 87 and 47 in his second Test. He never quite settled until a big century at the WACA in the third Test of the 2017-18 Ashes. He followed that with another, in Sydney - brought up amid emotional scenes with his brother at the crease - and then made a pivotal match-winning 96 in a Test win in Durban before Australian cricket plunged into crisis.It was the start of a period of decline for Marsh too. He only played one Test during the 2018-19 home summer, failing twice with the bat against India at the MCG. He returned as part of the Ashes squad in 2019, at The Oval, where he took his maiden five-wicket haul. Later that year, he broke his hand thumping the dressing-room wall at the WACA following a dismissal in the Sheffield Shield, disrupting his career again.He stormed back into Test contention in the 2023 Ashes after four years out of the side, replacing injured allrounder Cameron Green and producing a boundary-studded 118 at Headingley, were it not for which, Australia might have lost more emphatically than they did. In the Old Trafford Test that followed, he made a fifty and held out with a teeth-gritted 31 made over two and a half hours on the final day to secure the series as England threatened to blow Australias house down. In the BBL, Marsh has turned out most often for powerhouse side Perth Scorchers, winning three titles with them."

With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap. His talent was so blindingly obvious it was only a matter of when things clicked for him. He became the youngest fast bowler in Test history to take a five-wicket haul, doing so in Karachi against Sri Lanka in just his second match. Records continued to tumble, with Naseem becoming the youngest to take a Test match hat-trick in his third Test against Bangladesh. Bodies that young dont often have to handle the force required to generate that sort of speed, and what followed was a spate of injuries that initially impacted his performance before sidelining him for more than a year. It wasnt until the third Test against Australia in Lahore in March 2022 that Naseem returned to the international fold. Mercifully, the pace was still extreme and there were no signs of the injuries he had nursed during his time away.If anything, Naseem has gone on to become a potent white-ball player. Until as recently as August 2022, he had never played a white-ball international, but in Shaheen Afridis absence, has blossomed in that leading role. His first T20I career over, where he dismissed KL Rahul and toyed with Virat Kohli, was one Shaheen himself would have been proud of, and further performances in the Asia Cup only bolstered his reputation. Its easy to sometimes forget that the man currently spearheading Pakistans vaunted fast bowling line-up is just 19, and with the T20 WOrld Cup looming, he has the chance to go back to where his international career began and show the world how far  he has come. And, of course, how much farther he can still go. Danyal Rasool"

In his teens he gained a reputation as one of the fastest bowlers on the school circuit, which carried over into the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, where he bowled the competitions fastest delivery, a 147kph zinger that broke Zimbabwe batter Brendan Slys stumps. Joseph would finish as West Indies highest wicket-taker of the tournament, with 13 wickets from six games at an economy of 3.31.He had made it into the U-19 World Cup squad on the back of his first-class performances - in his second season with Leeward Islands in late 2015, he took his first five-for, against Guyana, and followed it up with 7 for 46 against Windward Islands in the next match. His 24 first-class wickets that season and the World Cup performance saw him fast-tracked into the Test side; he debuted against India at Gros Islet in August 2016 and bounced out Virat Kohli for 3 for his first wicket. His ODI debut came a few months later, against Pakistan in Sharjah. In 2019, Joseph was signed by Mumbai Indians as an injury replacement for Adam Milne, and in his first game, against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he returned figures of 6 for 12, the best figures by a bowler in the IPL."
Aaron Finch,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316533.png",Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Top order Batter,"A solidly built, aggressive batter from a country town in Victoria, Aaron Finch ascended to become Australias ODI and T20I captain, leading his country to their first T20 World Cup triumph in 2021. Finch has twice held the record for the highest score in a T20I: his 172 against Zimbabwe in 2018, surpassed the 156 against England in 2013. In 2014, Finch was named Australias T20I captain, replacing George Bailey, but on the eve of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India, the selectors decided to consolidate the captaincy of all three formats and handed the job to Steven Smith. Finch at the time was the No.1-ranked T20I batter in the world but found himself suddenly struggling to hold on to his place in the side - though he had been an automatic selection in Australias ODI and T20I teams, and had set the tone for their triumphant 2015 World Cup with 135 in their opening match against England at the MCG. In 2018, amid a meltdown in Australian cricket in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal at Newlands, Finch found himself installed as the permanent national white-ball captain. He also made his Test debut in 2018 on the back of his white-ball form, scoring 62 and 49 on debut in Dubai against Pakistan, but endured a form slump in the home 2018-19 season after trying to adjust his technique to Test cricket and was dropped from the side. He retired from one-day cricket in 2022 after a lean run with the bat, although he did lead Australia to a 2-0 win over New Zealand in his final series.Finch made his first-class debut for Victoria at 21 but did not play his first Sheffield Shield match until two years later.  Victoria had not always viewed him in their preferred Shield batting order, and nearly three years passed between his second and third first-class centuries. He made an unbeaten 288 against New Zealand in a first-class tour match in Blacktown in 2015-16, although that game was ultimately abandoned as the New Zealanders complained about the condition of the pitch. Finch is an in-demand T20 cricketer, having played for nine IPL franchises as well as for Yorkshire and Surrey in England. He has also been a mainstay of the Melbourne Renegades side since the inception of the BBL and captained the team to their first BBL title in 2019."
Steven Smith,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316609.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Middle order Batter,"In a career of twists and turns, Steven Smith started out as a legspinner and become Australias best batter since Sir Donald Bradman, either side of having his career derailed by a ball-tampering scandal that saw him stripped of the captaincy and banned for 12 months.The rise from that controversy at Newlands in 2018 was near-miraculous: Smith returned to Test cricket with a 774-run Ashes series in 2019, and pictures of him in tears at Sydney airport after his return in disgrace from South Africa were replaced in the popular memory with those of triumphant celebrations of centuries. Part of his punishment for Cape Town was being banned from any leadership position for two years, but once he served that penance, in late 2021 he was named Pat Cummins vice-captain and a few weeks later led the side against England when Cummins was ruled out of a Test by Covid.Smith began his Test career in 2010 as a legspinner who batted at No. 8; by the time he was named Australias captain five years later, he was the No. 1 Test batter in the world and no more than an occasional bowler. His talent was apparent early, but as a young batter he had more moving parts than an orchestra - only, they didnt always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few others that defied words besides. Quick-footed and adept at facing spin, he is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers.When he was appointed Australias 45th Test captain, Smith was filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. That was during a markedly purple patch, even by his standards: he produced six hundreds in eight Tests then, against India, West Indies and England. Despite being only 25 at the time, the extra responsibility clearly didnt hamper his run-making, and Smith cemented his spot when Clarke retired at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England.As Smiths batting developed, his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field his athleticism and instinct stand out, even in a high-quality fielding side like Australia. He has also been a key man in Australias ODI side, was his countrys leading run-scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign, and became captain in all three formats before his career was turned upside down."

But, although he was involved with the county for four years, the seam-bowling allrounder failed to push on, and he was released at the end of 2013 and moved west to Somerset. Born in Aberdeen, Davey made his ODI debut in 2010, the same year as his first county appearance, and immediately made a sterling impression by taking 5 for 9 against Afghanistan. At the time, they were Scotlands best ever bowling figures in ODI cricket. In 2012 he took 3 for 23 in Scotlands win over Bangladesh in a T20 international, which was their first ever victory over an ICC Full Member. While he was highly regarded by many in Scottish cricket, the sense that Davey was not fulfilling his talent was reinforced when, a few months after losing his Middlesex contract, he was not selected in the Scotland squad for the World Cup Qualifiers in January 2014. However, he soon earned a summer contract with Somerset, and took 3 for 28 from his four overs when he was recalled for the rain-reduced ODI against England in May. Consistent bowling for Scotland in the summer of 2014 and in their World Cup acclimatisation tour was adorned by a return of 6 for 28 against Afghanistan, which represented the best ODI bowling display by a non-Test player. It ensured Daveys place in the final 15 for the World Cup. He made his first-team debut in a solitary outing against the New Zealand tourists in 2015 and added a single Championship appearance the following year as well as a smattering of T20 appearances in which he showed good economy.Davey was initially a fringe seamer at Somerset, but he won more opportunities in 2018 when 34 Championship wickets gave him his best seasons return. He started to thrive in their white-ball sides, too, taking 14 wickets - including both Hampshire openers in the final - as they won the Royal London Cup in 2019, and became an integral member of their squad.He represented Scotland at the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups: in the first, he took eight wickets in three matches in Oman to clinch a place in the Super 12s in the UAE, though an injury meant he only played twice at that stage of the tournament.

He was one of the top three bowlers, and was duly picked by the scouts to a training camp in Dhaka.He immediately impressed Aaqib Javed, who had come to Bangladesh as a short-term fast bowling consultant, before making his first-class debut for Sylhet against Rajshahi. It was followed by a draft pick in the BPL, by Rajshahi Kings. But Ebadats breakthrough came at the start of the 2018-19 domestic season, having taken 21 wickets in the BCL first-class tournament. It included a 10-wicket haul against North Zone, including international batsmen Najmul Hossain Shanto, Marshall Ayub and Mosaddek Hossain.He also impressed during the 2019 BPL, including figures of 4 for 17 against Chittagong Vikings in Sylhet Sixers last game.

He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. It\s nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns, was a quip from the New Zealand camp.He made his Test debut later that year in the first ever day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide and made 31 and 45 batting at No.6 in both innings in a low-scoring game. He also took two wickets. Over the next four years his Test opportunities were limited but he became a mainstay in the white-ball teams for the Black Caps. His performances were so impressive that he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in 2019 IPL to play under Stephen Fleming. He won a game by hitting a six off the last ball of the match against Rajasthan and took 2 for 13 from 4 overs in the IPL final against Mumbai, including the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma. His experience in that cauldron held him in good stead for the 2019 World Cup in England. He bowled a clutch spell in the semi-final win over India, strangling their middle order to help secure a spot in the final against England. Later in the same year he recorded a maiden Test century during an epic partnership with BJ Watling. The 261 they added was New Zealand\s highest seventh-wicket stand in history and helped their side to 615-9, their highest Test total against England. The three wickets he claimed in England\s second-innings also constituted new Test-best figures and helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadrans batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match.

Nurul made his T20I debut in January 2016, against Zimbabwe, one of many experiments that the selectors indulged in ahead of the Asia Cup and the World T20. His ODI debut was equally accidental as Mushfiqur sustained a hamstring injury on the tour of New Zealand in December. Nurul was only the fifth wicketkeeper to make an ODI debut since Mushfiqurs career began in 2006. Nurul spent three years at the Under-19 level, playing in two World Cups in 2010 and 2012.

Paul Stirling,Ireland,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316638.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Paul Stirling has long been recognised as a formidable cricketing talent both in Ireland and beyond. Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket. Born in Belfast, Stirling made his ODI debut at the age of just 17. He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland\s victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland\s ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland\s tie with Pakistan two years later. Stirling also revealed his big match temperament with a pair of blistering innings - 79 off 38 balls and 76 off 43 balls - against Afghanistan in the finals of the World T20 qualifiers in 2012 and 2013. While Stirling made a fine impression for Middlesex in limited overs cricket, he languished in the second eleven in the Championship. But when he got a chance in 2014, he averaged 43.87 in six games, suggesting that he was capable of managing the transition between the white and red ball. Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland\s most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup.Stirling had long been a curious case in first-class cricket. The discrepancy between his first-class and limited overs returns for Middlesex had been infuriating. Before his maiden Championship hundred, he averaged 27.77 for the county against the red ball, but 41.46 in one-day cricket. So that century, against Yorkshire at Lord\s in 2017, was a perfect celebration of Ireland\s elevation to Test status which was formally confirmed on the other side of the Thames, at The Oval, a few days later. It\s about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don\t want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket. That\s the balance I have to find.Ireland were eagerly seeking to develop club standards as their status in international cricket grew but another century upon Stirling\s return to play for his boyhood club, Cliftonville, caused brief resentment later that summer as rules excluded players with recent first-class experience from playing at this standard.  Farcical was how a tweet from Armagh described it after Stirling bulldozed their attack. Stirling captained Ireland for the first time in 2018 at the Hong Kong Sixes, and often found himself filling in when a first-choice skipper was elsewhere.As his belligerent form in white-ball internationals continued, Stirling found himself forced to make an unexpected choice in 2019 on account of Ireland\s ascent to Test status: either, he could continue to play for Ireland, but count as an overseas player in county cricket, or he could renew his Middlesex contract but forego his international career. He admitted he was baffled, but chose the former before signing a short-term deal to play for Northants as their second overseas player in the 2020 T20 Blast, despite being born in Belfast and holding a British passport.ESPNcricinfo staff"

He impressed on that trip, hitting two smart fifties from four innings, to finish as the teams second-highest run-scorer.Those performances earned him a national call-up for the home series against West Indies in November. Gunathilaka then earned a second trip to New Zealand - with the senior team this time - and despite modest returns from his first three ODIs, he struck a rapid 65 in Nelson to win a Man-of-the-Match award.Gunathilaka was not originally part of Sri Lankas squad for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England, but came into it ahead of their second match thanks to an injury to Chamara Kapugedara. He made a stunning entrance, scoring 76 off 72 balls to help haul down a target of 322. That innings was followed by a run of three fifties and a maiden hundred in the ODI series against Zimbabwe, cue a call-up to the Test side. The Test debut was a disappointment, Gunathilaka scoring 16 and 2 before falling to loose strokes in both innings.Strong square of the wicket, particularly on the off side, Gunathilaka, who admires Kumar Sangakkara, is also a part-time offspinner.

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. Karthik was still a giant in domestic cricket though, and had a knack for turning up on turning tracks. No doubt his penchant to sweep, reverse sweep and hare down that track at spinners helped his cause. Those quick feet have at times failed him behind the stumps - often at crucial junctures. He was recalled to the Indian side for a tour of Bangladesh in 2014 - but his wicketkeeping let him down.Karthik made over 1000 first-class runs in the 2008-09 season, with five centuries including a 213 as Tamil Nadu captain as they reached the semi-finals. For five seasons since - barring 2010-11, 2013 when he played only one match and 2015-16 - he had maintained a batting average above 40. Karthik found himself in contention again after Dhonis retirement in 2014, but Wriddhiman Saha was preferred because he was seen as the stronger keeper.An in-and-out history with the Indian team didnt help. He was picked in the one-day squad, as replacement for Parthiv Patel in August 2004, and made his debut in a NatWest Challenge game against England where he pulled off a superb stumping. Shortly afterwards, he was called up to make his Test debut against Australia but when he could manage only one fifty in ten matches, he was axed.He made a comeback in 2008 - picked in the Indian side for all three formats for a tour of New Zealand - but his middling performances continued over the following year and did not allow him to cement a place in the team. He fell out of contention, until a fine 2012-13 domestic season got him back into the ODI side for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England but it proved to be another false dawn.Karthik may feel unfulfilled when he looks back on his international career, but the IPL should have helped soothe him. He was bought at INR 12.5 crore by Delhi Daredevils in the 2014 auction and the next year, he netted INR 10.5 crore courtesy Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was acquired by Gujarat Lions for INR 2.3 crore in 2016.ESPNcricinfo staff"

Ngidi was schooled at Kwa-Zulu Natals Hilton College and was involved at every provincial age-group level from Under-13 upwards. He played for Kwa-Zulu Natal Under-19s at the Khaya Majola week in 2014, where he was spotted by Northerns. They facilitated his move up country, where he honed his skills at the University of Pretoria. Ngidi was identified as a T20 prospect early on when he finished as the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the Africa Cup, a provincial T20 tournament that serves as a curtain raiser to the season, in September 2015. His six wickets came at an average of 12.50 and helped Northerns win the title. He was named Africa T20 Cup player of the year and was also promoted to the franchise team, Titans, for parts of their T20 campaign. Ngidi played in the final for Titans in 2015-16, which they won, and was a central figure in their title defence the following season. In January 2017, Ngidi was picked for South Africas T20 squad to face Sri Lanka and was named Man of the Match on debut. Having largely been touted as a limited-overs prospect till then, a surprise was in store a year later: a maiden Test cap arrived against India in Centurion, and, yet again, what a debut it was. Ngidis second-innings six-for helped South Africa knock India over for 151 and wrap up the series. Once again, he was named Man of the Match on debut.Firdose Moonda"

He finished second on the tournament wicket tally behind Mitchell Starc. He was rewarded with being named in the ICCs team of the tournament alongside skipper Kane Williamson. A sporadic presence in the Auckland side in his first two first-class seasons, Ferguson had a breakthrough season in 2014-15, in which his 21 wickets came at an average of 23.38. He took 31 wickets the following year, when he also entered the List A side, enjoying further success there. It was for limited-overs cricket that he first entered the New Zealand squad: he was picked in the ODI side to Australia in December 2016, after an injury to Adam Milne had left the team short of an out-and-out fast bowler. Making his debut in Sydney, Ferguson took the wicket of David Warner in his first over.He has become a major weapon in ODI and T20 cricket. He played in the IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders and Rising Pune Supergiant. He has played first-class cricket for New Zealand A and did an extended stint in England with Derbyshire in 2018. A Test debut came against Australia in Perth in late 2019, but was seemingly a source of great frustration for Ferguson: he didnt last the match, sidelined by a calf strain in the second session of day one.\nESPNCricinfo staff"

After a long recovery process, he was handy a substantial contract for Barbados Tridents in the 2016 CPL on Kieron Pollards recommendation. Unsure whether his body would continue to hold up, Pooran looked to maximise his earnings by playing in every franchise league he could including the BPL, the PSL, the Hong Kong Blitz, the T10 and for West Indies B in the Global T20 Canada. His first BPL deal, in 2016-17, earned him a ban from the WICB, who were displeased at his decision not to play regional cricket instead.His international breakthrough came in late 2018, when he hit his first half-century for West Indies off just 24 balls against India in Chennai. From there, he was parachuted into the World Cup squad, and given an opportunity as West Indies No. 4 despite limited experience in 50-over cricket. He hit fifties against England and Afghanistan, plus a thrilling hundred against Sri Lanka, and finished the tournament with an average of 52.47 and a strike rate of 100.After an underwhelming first season for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL - he was previously picked up by Mumbai Indians in 2017 but did not play a game - he enjoyed a stellar 2020 season in the UAE, making 353 runs at a strike rate of 170, demonstrating his ability to dominate against spin and also pulling off a remarkable boundary save in the deep. He had come into the season off the back of a maiden T20 hundred for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the CPL, and followed it by playing his first first-class games in over six years for West Indies A in New Zealand.ESPNcricinfo staff"

Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australias Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame.Hazlewood grew up with Glenn McGrath as his idol and was handed a rookie state contract for 2008-09, despite still being in year 12 in Tamworth, in country New South Wales. At the time, he had not even played a game for a Sydney grade club. But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career. Both men had made their Test debuts at 23 and Hazlewood reached 100 Test wickets in 46 innings, just one innings slower than his idol. Along the way, Hazlewood was only once dropped from the side: mentally and physically fatigued, he was left out of the fifth and final Ashes Test in England in 2015, despite a collection of 16 wickets at 25.75 in the series. When the Ashes next came around, in 2017-18, he claimed 21 wickets in Australias 4-0 victory.After the leadership upheaval following the Newlands ball-tampering scandal, he was named joint vice-captain of the Test team but missed the tour of the UAE due to a back issue. Another back injury following the 2018-19 home series against India saw him replaced as vice-captain and miss out on the World Cup squad, having been part of Australias successful campaign in 2015, but he was the man who claimed the wicket to retain the Ashes at Old Trafford a few months later.\nESPNcricinfo staff"

It was quite the birthday present, considering he had not even been capped in internationals for UAE. Suri never suited up for Lions, but he has demonstrated his talents in the time since his UAE international debut, also in 2017, rocketing up the career batting charts to figure among the top five run-makers in both ODIs and T20Is for his country. He made his debut in the now-defunct Intercontinental Cup first-class tournament for Associates, and has gone on to showcase his skills in the shorter formats as a steady accumulator and sometimes match-winner at the top of the order, most often playing the anchor role while others slot in around him. Early in 2022, Suri produced three T20I scores of 80-plus in a nine-match run across tournaments in Oman, against Nepal, Germany and Kuwait. Growing respect for him within the team was highlighted by his elevation to the vice-captaincy in early 2021 under the leadership of Ahmed Raza, though a shake-up saw both men ousted in 2022."

His father was unemployed, his mother had contracted hepatitis, and the family was struggling to deal with the needs of his disabled sister. Happily, he was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011, and his full-time central contract helped to bring a little more stability to his home. Since then, hes settled into a floating role in Afghanistans middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball, and his game has progressed most rapidly in crickets shortest format.

Dockrell played a key role in Irelands 2010 T20 World Cup campaign, seeing off Netherlands in the qualifying tournament before taking 3 for 16 against West Indies and choking Englands middle order with four overs for 19 runs. School exams then prevented him facing Australia in an ODI but a month later he was offered a contract at Somerset.He made headlines after trapping Sachin Tendulkar lbw in the 2011 ODI World Cup as an 18-year-old, and went on to captain Ireland in the 2012 Under-19 World Cup, finishing that year as the ICC Associate Player of the Year. Three years later, he took 3 for 50 in a big win over West Indies in the ODI World Cup in Australia, Ireland won three of their six games.By the turn of the decade, Dockrell was evolving into a batting allrounder, batting as high as No. 5 when previously he had been slotted in at No. 10 or 11. In 2021 he scored a 45 in an ODI win over South Africa. The following year, he made a T20I half-century against Afghanistan, and helped Ireland seal one of their three victories in the T20I World Cup.His father, Derek, also represented Ireland in the days when the side was all-amateur and not allowed to qualify for the World Cup."

At the age of 19 he had a place in the squads of Western Australia, Perth Scorchers, and the national team, having sensationally been upgraded from an internship on the 2013 tour of India to a more expansive role in Michael Clarkes squad. Agars rapid rise continued when he made an unforgettable debut in the Ashes Test at Trent Bridge in 2013. Coming in at No. 11, with Australia reeling at 117 for 9, he struck an astonishing 98 - the highest Test score ever by a No. 11 - playing strokes that top-order batters would be proud of. He then picked up Alastair Cook as his maiden victim, thus becoming the first teenaged Australian spinner to take a Test wicket.Of Sri Lankan background and a 187cm frame, Agar had the pedigree and the physical attributes to suggest his left-arm spin would be successful, impressing many on his first-class debut for WA against New South Wales at Blacktown Oval. After his startling start to international cricket, further success was harder to come by as he failed to become a regular in any format. But by 2020 he had settled into the T20I set-up, forming a promising pairing with legspinner Adam Zampa. Against South Africa in Johannesburg that year, he took 5 for 24, then the best figures for Australia in T20Is, which included a hat-trick, and a year later, bettered it with 6 for 30 against New Zealand in Wellington."
Shakib Al Hasan,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316581.png",Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.In ODIs, Shakibs contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasnt surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakibs removal as captain.His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015. In the 2019 World Cup, Shakib hit his peak with the bat: playing the No. 3 role, he went past fifty in seven out of eight innings, with a lowest score of 41. That streak included two centuries, including an unbeaten 124 off 99 balls as Bangladesh chased down West Indies 321 inside 42 overs - a record ODI chase for the country. Shakib finished the tournament third on the batting charts with 606 runs at 86.57, and also took a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan. The highs from that World Cup would dissolve shortly after. Shakib was suspended from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after accepting three charges of breaching the ICCs anti-corruption code. He was found guilty of not reporting approaches from bookies during series with Bangladesh as well as at the IPL during his time with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The suspension would have effectively ended his chances of participating in the T20 World Cup in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic meant the tournament was postponed, and that a large part of Shakibs suspension went by without his missing too much cricket with the national team. Shakib was back in the set up soon after, and said he regretted and repented his actions, and that the suspension and the pandemic had made him rethink life.In 2021, he had another run-in with the authorities. This time, during the Dhaka Premier League. Playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club against Abahani Limited, Shakib was caught on video first kicking the stumps and remonstrating with the umpire after his lbw appeal had been turned down, and later ripping them out in anger after the umpire called for the covers when it had begun to rain. He was subsequently banned for three matches and fined Taka 5 lakh (USD 5800 approx).Mohammad Isam & ESPNcricinfo staff"

Later that year, he took three in a famous win against England in an ODI, Scotlands first. Watt won opportunities with Lancashire that summer, although he only took one wicket in four matches.He was instrumental in Scotland winning the Oman Quadrangular T20I Series in 2019, taking three wickets apiece in each of their two victories, over Ireland and Oman. Later that year, in the T20 World Cup Qualifier in the UAE, he took 12 wickets as Scotland went through to the event (which was deferred to 2021 due to Covid).When Scotland made a charge to the ODI World Cup Qualifiers in 2023, topping the table in the World Cricket League Division 2, Watt turned in crucial performances: in Aberdeen in 2022, he took 11 wickets in three games, against USA and UAE. He went a notch better in December that year and February 2023, when in seven games against Nepal and Namibia in Windhoek and Kirtipur, he took 20 wickets.

That innings gave him an unbroken run in the white-ball sides for about four years, during which time he cemented his position as one of the teams top finishers. That is also the role he has played in the IPL, featuring in all of Delhi Capitals games in their run to the final in 2020, and doing likewise with Lucknow Super Giants in 2023. In between, Stoinis helped guide Australia to a win in the 2021 T20 World Cup, putting on a remarkable stand of 81 with Matthew Wade in the semi-final against Pakistan after Australia were in strife at 96 for 5 chasing 177. In the BBL, on the other hand, he has been an opener for Melbourne Stars.Stoinis moved back to Western Australia in 2017 for family reasons and was a regular in the first-class side for three seasons, though his returns were middling; he next played when he briefly figured in the title-winning WA side in 2022-23."

With Pakistan struggling to put together a solid opening combination, Masood was the option they turned to in the Test series against South Africa in the UAE.Masood caught the eye of Pakistans talent-spotters quite early, being selected as a 13-year-old for the U-15 Asia Cup in 2002 after impressing Aaqib Javed. In his first-class debut game in 2007, Masood scored 54 for Karachi, putting together 154 for the opening wicket with Asad Shafiq. Thereafter, he also played well in England: in 2009, he was particularly successful for Stamford school in 2009, scoring 1237 runs at an average of 103, a school record. He also played three first-class games for Durham University, facing the likes of Liam Plunkett, Graham Onions and Ajmal Shehzad.Back in Pakistan, Masood had an excellent home season in 2012-13, scoring 543 runs at an average of 54.30. The reward was a call-up to open the batting in the Test series against South Africa. Masoods role model is Alastair Cook, which says something about the kind of batsman he wants to become.ESPNcricinfo staff"
Adil Rashid,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319741.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"Adil Rashid did much to set right English crickets troubled relationship with legspin when he established himself as the countrys leading white-ball spinner in 2015 and four years later was a key part of their World Cup-winning side. At the time of Rashids recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200.His success in the limited-overs game owed much to his variation - and his wicked googly in particular - and it was no great surprise when he got his Test debut in 2015 against Pakistan. Rashid took 60 wickets in 19 Tests, but often struggled for control and a long-standing shoulder complaint meant his focus returned to the shorter formats after the 2019 tour of the Caribbean.Born in Bradford, he became the third Yorkshire-born player of Asian extraction to represent the county in 2006, and his 6 for 67  on debut against Warwickshire at Scarborough felt like a breakthrough moment. In 2008, he earned call-ups as a back-up player on Test tours to India and the Caribbean after taking 62 Championship wickets.He made his England debut in 2009 during the World T20, playing in all four of Englands games, but had a chastening time on the tour to South Africa the following winter: his only over in the T20I series cost 25 runs and his three overs in an ODI in Centurion were taken for 27. Rashids county progress was mixed over the next few years but as he reached his mid-20s, he became a more prolific run-scorer, and he thrived with Jason Gillespie as his head coach at Yorkshire, who later took him to the Big Bash with Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won titles in 2014 and 2015. For England, he was part of the side that reached the final of the 2016 World T20 and the semi-final of the 2017 Champions Trophy, and took 11 wickets in the 2019 World Cup. His introduction to Test cricket was brutal as he returned 0 for 163 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2015, but his 5 for 64 in the second innings demonstrated why England had been so keen to turn him into a red-ball bowler. He was their leading wicket-taker in India in 2016-17 with 23 - 13 more than anyone else - but averaged the wrong side of 35 and leaked 3.70 runs an over.Controversy reared its head in 2018, when, months after signing a white-ball-only contract with Yorkshire, Rashid was handed a Test recall for the home series against India by Ed Smith, a selector keen to think outside the box. He took ten wickets in the series before forming part of a spin trio with Moeen Ali and Jack Leach during Englands 3-0 win in Sri Lanka, but after an expensive Test in the Caribbean in early 2019, he was left out once more.However, he remained arguably the pre-eminent asset in Englands rebooted white-ball team, and despite despite a long-standing shoulder issue that has required constant monitoring, in 2022 he added the T20 World Cup crown to the 50-over title from 2019. His displays at the sharp end of that competition in Australia epitomised his value - a combined return of 4 for 58 in his final 12 overs of the tournament, including 2 for 22 in the final against Pakistan."
Sean Williams,Zimbabwe,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316568.png",Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Middle order Batter,"Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwes finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering.Reverse-sweeps aside, Williams has other shots too, and plays them often. His precocious talent was apparent while he was still a teenager. He was expected to be called up at the time of the players strike in April 2004, but his father Collin, a former first-class player and national hockey coach, refused to release him and insisted his son should concentrate more on his studies. Almost a year later, and with just one first-class match under his belt, he was drafted into the Zimbabwe squad to tour South Africa. Although he led the U-19 side in the World Cup in Sri Lanka in February 2006 - the highlight being a win over England - there were rumours both before and after the tournament that he was not happy with the board. This turned out to be true when he turned down a central contract the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas. He changed his mind three months later, however, returning to play for Zimbabwe. The on-off farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later. One feels that disciplinary issues, whether perceived or actual, are never far away with Williams, who often speaks in as forthright a manner as he bats. He is one of Zimbabwes best players of spin but was was not considered for selection for Zimbabwes tour of Bangladesh in late 2014 after interruptions in his involvement in a training camp and an aborted disciplinary hearing. Williams responded to his omission with two centuries, a 96 and 10 wickets for Tuskers while Zimbabwe were away, underlining just what they were missing. If he is managed well Williams has the potential to be an all-round match-winner for Zimbabwe. He has a more-than-useful second string as a left-arm spinner and a keen cricketing brain, having captained Zimbabwe Under-19 and Matabeleland Tuskers on occasion.Liam Brickhill"
Shoriful Islam,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323175.png",Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"At 6ft three inches, Shoriful Islam became a left-arm pace sensation almost overnight, when he starred in Bangladeshs 2020 Under-19 World Cup triumph. He took nine wickets, but it was his aggression and pace in the knockout games against South Africa, New Zealand and (in the final against) India that stood out.They returned home in February to much adulation and many prizes, but shortly afterwards got stuck at home by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the two domestic competitions to kick off the 2020-21 season, Shoriful looked to have taken a step further, and earned a maiden call-up to the ODI side in January 2021, for the three-match series against West Indies.It brought cheer to Nagardanga, the small village in northern Bangladesh where he was born, and from where he would cycle for half an hour to get to the closest bazaar to have electricity, so that he could watch live cricket on TV. When he saw Mustafizur Rahman bowl left-arm pace during the 2015 India series, Shorifuls dream got bigger.The following year, he was spotted by Alamgir Kabir, a bowling coach for Clemon Rajshahi Cricket Academy, during a trial in Dinajpur. Kabir took him under his wing, and taught him how to bowl, and how to be a cricketer. Within a year, he was playing first-class cricket for Rajshahi, and by mid-2018, he would appear for Bangladesh A in two series.Shoriful got transferred into the Under-19 programme where bowling coach Mahbub Ali Zaki built him into a fast bowler from a medium-pacer. Shorifuls World Cup-winning performance took the country by storm, with many expecting him to be in the national team soon. That expectation became reality at the turn of 2021 when he earned his first call-up in the Bangladesh side.Mohammad Isam"
Hardik Pandya,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319938.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Allrounder Hardik Pandyas calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence. Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to Indias search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in Indias squad for that years T20 World Cup. While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldnt have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans run to their second final in a row."
Tabraiz Shamsi,South Africa,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322068.png",Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"A left-arm wristspin bowler with ample variations and a good googly, Tabraiz Shamsi emerged as South Africa were starting to warm to the wave of spinners being produced at domestic levels, although it took a while for him to come through. Shamsi bounced between the Highveld and Kwa-Zulu Natal and pushed for a place at franchise level after a strong 2013-14 season for Easterns. He took 47 wickets at 20.02 to finish third in the three-day cup wicket-takers list, and then played five matches in the 2014-15 franchise 20-over competition where caught the eye of the touring West Indians, who were visiting South Africa that summer. In 2015, Shamsi was bought by Caribbean Premier League franchise St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, where Eric Simons was coach. There, Shamsi rose to some prominence, taking 11 wickets at 13.27 in the seven matches he played.More regular opportunities in franchise cricket came the next season and Shamsi took them. He finished as the leading spinner in South Africas first-class competition in the 2015-16 summer, in which he took 41 wickets at 19.97 in Titans title-run. In 2016, he was picked up by the IPLs Royal Challengers Bangalore as a replacement player for the injured Samuel Badree which meant that Shamsi had played in two T20 leagues before picked for the national side. His ODI debut finally came in a triangular series in the Caribbean in June 2016. That same year he made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide and the following June, he played his first T20 international. But Shamsi struggled to find a regular place in the South African side, with Keshav Maharaj established as the Test spinner and Imran Tahir their white-ball specialist. Shamsi was part of the 2019 World Cup squad and played two matches but it was only after Tahirs ODI retirement after the 2019 World Cup that Shamsi came into his own. In the 2019-20 summer, he finished second on the Mzansi Super League wicket-charts and was a star performer in the Paarl Rocks tournament-winning campaign and was afforded a regular run in white-ball series against England and Australia. In addition to his ability to take wickets, he also demonstrated the capacity to hold an end, something South Africa have always wanted from their spinners."
Sam Curran,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323113.png",Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12. Punjab Kings subsequently made him the most expensive buy at an IPL auction, outbidding five other teams to acquire his services for INR 18.50 crore (£1.85 million approximately). Back in 2018, the same franchise - Kings XI Pubjab, as they were known at the time - purchased him for INR 7.2 crore (£800,000 approximately). It was at the IPL, while playing for Chennai Super Kings, he showed his dexterity as a makeshift opening batter, having primarily been used as a hitter down the order. His absence from Test duties in 2022 was more through circumstance than design. A back injury ruled him out of the 2021/22 Ashes which took time to shake off. Now, however, both player and national team are aligned. As a leftie in both disciplines, his skillset is a rarity as far as English red ball bowling stocks are concerned, and his composure with bat in hand has never been questioned. Having fallen in the nineties twice in first class cricket, he finally made it to three figures in June 2022 with 126 against Kent. It was his 120th innings in the format. Curran has belied his slight frame from the moment he entered Surreys 1st X1 in 2015, showing a natural ability to swing his left-armers at a decent lick and full of ambition at the crease. The combative nature of his cricket marked him down as a special cricketer in the making, winning attention from England Lions at the end of the 2016 season.Curran made an eye-catching Championship debut against Kent at The Oval when he took five wickets in the first innings, eight in all in the match, at only 17. Surrey research suggested he was the youngest-ever player to achieve a five-wicket haul in the Championship and the second youngest Surrey debutant. He opened the bowling with his brother, Tom, and took a wicket with his fifth ball when an inswinger bowled Joe Denly. At 17 years and 40 days old, his first-class debut came 69 years to the day after Tony Lock, the youngest player to play for Surrey at 17 years and eight days, made his first appearance - also against Kent - at the Oval on July 13, 1946. He showed an ability to swing the ball into the right-hander from the outset. That there was aggression, too, was evident even before his debut when he filled in for a Surrey T20 practice match and struck Gary Wilson on the helmet with one of the first balls he bowled. His laid-back personality was also evident when he was given a day off school by Wellington College, where he was taking A levels in PE, Art and Business Studies, to play in a Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at The Oval, where he first came to the attention of a wider audience with a composed, energetic display.Two successive runners-up medals in the Royal London Cup final, as Surrey lost Lords finals against Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, were not a bad start for a player still only 18, but such is Currans competitive nature, it is doubtful that he found much consolation in either of them. In a 2016 summer that brought so much to admire with bat and ball, there was a 96 against Lancashire - ended when a tame return catch to the offspinner Arron Lilley was followed by a disconsolate walk from the crease, in the words of ESPNcricinfos reporter, as if he had just lost a game of Pokemon Go - and four wickets in seven ball against Durham on the way to the first six-for of his Championship career.\nESPNcricinfo staff"
